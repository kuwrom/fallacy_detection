The “prophet” Nostradamus wrote about 500 years ago: Beasts wild with hunger will cross the rivers, The greater part of the battle will be against Hister. He will cause great men to be dragged in a cage of iron, When the son of Germany obeys no law. Surely he must have had some vision of Hitler!When you focus on just that prediction, then it might seem that way, but realize that Nostradamus made over 1000 “predictions”, most (all?) of which are vague nonsense.  Given that many predictions, it is statistically impossible NOT to match at least one with an actual event.  Again, if you ignore the noise (the predictions that do not make any sense), it looks amazing.  By the way, “Hister” is the Latin name for the Danube River.,
