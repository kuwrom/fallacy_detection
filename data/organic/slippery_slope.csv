From a libertarian perspective, I'm opposed to any government mandated medical procedure.  Even a harmless or beneficial procedure may be starting us down a slippery slope.  In practice, I think government mandated vaccines are a net positive.  We're probably not going down that slippery slope, so I'm fine with not letting some facebook mom group bring back polio.
Welfare exists to make people lazy. And when people get lazy, they stop thinking and become sheep. And thats what the Democrats want. Sheep for their big government to dominate. /s
If Trump can set the bar for what a president can get away with doesn't that make the next one who pushes the boundaries of breaking the law further until they start committing genocide and everyone thinks its okay?
The problem with testing is that it's probably left to the states to implement, and they can make it *de facto* impossible to pass (or possibly even sit the exam), or worse, allow preferential treatment/make it prohibitively expensive to accomplish and therefore accomplish a gun ban.  For example, let's say there's a class, but there's 10 people in the entire state (Let's say, California) that are allowed to teach the class, it takes two weeks, and you can't teach more than 50 people at time. Also, it costs $800 to take, meaning you lock out a lot of people that can't afford.
I think you should stay in unless it's for groceries or a trip to the pharmacy but I don't like this one fucking bit. Are we going to have to start showing papers before we leave our houses like Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union? Ok, comrade.
The following qoute sums up my thoughts rather well;   *He who fights monsters should see to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.*   Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil  The means does not always justify the end, no matter how much 'good' the end does.
Ive mentioned this more than once in conversations. Its the same process every time standards change.  1. ______ should be acceptable because they cant help it/have a disease/were born like this. 2. Now that ______ is acceptable, ______ will be next. 3. Ill never except _____! Its wrong!  Then you repeat steps 1 - 3.   Personally I think anyone that has harmed a child should be publicly castrated, but thats just my opinion. Id bet money in the next few years there will be a big push against pedophiliaphobe, and if you cant accept them for who they are youre a bigot, blah blah blah.
Storage/use of personal data. This has been a big issues in countries like Sweden.
Police state's wet dream.
If we continue under Mr. Ford's policy by 1985 or '90 we'll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons. This has got to be stopped. That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president.
that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return. And that means war.
Yeah, I may get shit on here for this, but I think it's a gross violation to take away somebody's constitutional right over a misdemeanor. I hope this goes all the way to the supreme court and gets shut down immediately.  A DUI has nothing to do with guns. It's clear they're trying to get around the constitution to implement gun control any way possible.  If you support this remember one thing. This about more than just guns. If they can take away a CONSTITUTIONAL right for a fucking MISDEMEANOR, well. They could take away just about anything after that becomes a precedent.
Not going to lie, I'm okay with this.   I'm a leftist. And we need to vote tomorrow.   If today is coronavirus, what will it be tomorrow where they will move an election?    Right now Donald Trump is making policy on some b******* that he sees on Infowars. What will our next governor say in order to move an election?
They sound just like those people saying when gay marriage gets legalised theyre going to allow bestiality and incest
Yeah why don't we just speak every sentence about a given country in that country's language
Why are they always pushing for mor and more degeneracy all the time. First they have gay acceptance marriage, then the troomers start popping up, then we get idiots who wear mascot outfits and fuck animals, then we get sweaty neckbeards who have anime profile pics and sexualize children, and now they want us to date and marry people who are loaded with diseases and fuck other people.
Completely brainwashed people. They cheer them on as they take away their liberties. If the government can shut down all of these businesses without any pushback or controversy imagine what they can get away with just a little more media support. Today I have to tell many people that they will not have employment for the next month because the state government has deemed it illegal to operate a sit down restaurant.
The point there isn't to disparrage or discourage women. It's more akin to putting a gay man as one of the real housewives (i have never watched that show so if this actually happened i apologize).  That's not being biased against or discouraging gay men, it's just that the show isn't about them.  That's what's going on with Drag Race. Drag Race celebrates women constantly. But the show is about Drag Queens which are men.  Women have TOOOONS of shows for themselves.  This show is for drag queens to have a medium for themselves. Do you know how upset people would be if every season less and less gay men drag queens got on the show because real women got on in their stead if they started letting women on?
Right, while we are at it, remove the 6 portals limitation, remove hardcore mode, also increase base life by 2000%, why not, game is too hard
If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy.
Restrict free speech?  That may hurt your protests the next time someone hurts your feelings.
Thank you for this.  It's laughable how often gamers cry about oh but what if I only play games like Tetris or Animal Crossing or *insert supposedly non-violent game here*?  It's like a heroin addict saying yeah but I only use FRESH needles, so it's not THAT bad, right?? The cognitive dissonance required to obtain that jarring lack of self awareness can only be attributed to a brain rotted by videogames.
Because it can easily encourage mass hysteria if hundreds of people are trying to suddenly stock up on toilet paper or canned beans or whatever. People are going to be encouraged to go out and buy shit before its all gone.
Sexualising young children (children beauty paegents) should be legal then? Why not include child porn while you're at it...
This is what's wrong with you. Spreading your agenda of cross-dressing next in line we will get your comics where you encourage hormone altering injections.     Edit: I encourage you to raise your kid in such a weird manner. Anyway your comics have little impact in my country (i hope). So I don't care whether or not you make western men weak
it will be moved from being opt in to opt out to free for all with time. The voluntary part is just the trojan horse, don't fool yourself.
When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach. I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.
That's what they said about income tax in 1917 - it was just supposed to generate revenue for tge war effort. Yet here we are 103 years later and we all still pay it.
It's going to blow a hole in the deficit It's going to raise taxes on nine million people and require bigger cuts than the one I vetoed.
They always need to see how far they can push before it snaps back.  Gay marriage passed?  Lets move on to transgender.  That starts being ok?  Pedophilia becomes the next to be normalized.  So on and so forth until we stop this nonsense.
I use searches so I can't be accused of cherry picking.  This is all you have, why did you bother?
If south Europe Falls The north falls too
The very foundation of this persons belief is that, if we dont discourage homosexuality, the entirety of the human race will eventually become homosexual leading to a breakdown of society and the extinction of the human race.  Why the FUCK would anyone ever think that literally EVERYONE is going to eventually become LGBTQ+?  Thats this persons fear.  What the actual fuck?
Same with cars and you know what maybe a second home too and also a jet they should be rights
Then he goes on to say that he's going to change the interest-rate situation and we're going to get some more money that way. Well, what he is saying there in effect, we're going to have inflation. We're going to go right back to what we had under Mr. Truman when he had political control of the Federal Reserve Board.
Ontario has 5,000 and possible jail time for tresspasing on rail roads currently.    This just seems like it's more of that.    My only fear is different goverments will use this to introduce fines for things they don't like.    IE pro abortion groups protesting near hospital - major fine.   Protesting near a private company doing something you disagree with - fine.   Pro / anti lgbt protests - major fine.   This could head down a slippery slope quick.
well is it accepting it or is it treading the line without crossing it?  moving the line backwards so that these people arent treading the previous line - would lead to people treading that one, so another person like you would make demands to move it backwards - you see where this is going?  there is a reason that line is where it is
I agree entirely. It's a slippery slope from forced quarantine to martial law and forced curfews.
Well, yeah.   But the issue I have with it is not really the guns themselves. It's the actual removal of Constitutional Right. Remove one and they will keep going.   They love to bring out the Slippery Slope isn't real argument, though. While having absolute evidence of the contrary. Another argument they love to bring out is Yeah but they already amended the Constitution with the Prohibition!.   It's a bit infuriating.
I think you're foolish if you think at this point the Democrats in the establishment are going to play nice if they get the presidency. They've already seen what the Republican party can do with the presidency, why would the corporate entities who control the party want anything to do with normalcy? It is just as likely that they will try and set up their brand of an authoritarian government in the power vacuum that is left behind by Donald Trump's regime.
Yeah, we need to draw the line here. Otherwise it will eventually be 20 early-access cards 2 weeks early, then buying newpacks a month early with $$$... until the newest released set is gems-only!
youre fucking idiotic if you think the government breaking the constitution doesnt warrant this. guns first and then what?
Then 999 million, 99 million, 9 million, 999,000 etc. will be too much
Today it's bury the beans.  Tomorrow it's bury the bodies.  You dodged a bullet, my friend.  You'll have to keep track of the newspapers and let us know when she finally snaps and kills someone.
You have to sleep in order to function at work, so why not ask them to pay you rent while you are at it?
&gt;This type of stuff is what gives these nuts saying the lockdown is communism talking points.  Or maybe, just maybe, you might start to see that there's some validity to their concerns.
Gays led to trannys. Look at where we are now since we didnt stand up to gays.
How much is enough?  If you're only giving me $1000/mo I can't really afford a nice house, and I sure can't get that new bass boat.  Maybe $5000/mo would do the trick?  But I really need a big-ass Lexus SUV to tow my bass boat, and $5000 won't cover the SUV, the boat and my McMansion.  Can I have $10000/mo, please?  It's only fair.  My neighbor down the street still works for a living and I'm envious of his swimming pool; don't I deserve one, too?  The robot that replaced me cost the company $150,000 and it will only last 10 years.  But surely I deserve more than $15,000/yr.  That's only $1250/mo, and I've already explained why that isn't enough.  Do me a solid, OK?
When people say surveillance is a slippery slope, as with other fundamental rights, this is what they're talking about.  This is gut churning.
Now, you're -- and the way it would happen is that under his plan, if a school was designated as failing, the kids would be trapped there for another three years and then some of them would get federal vouchers and the state would be forced to match those, that money.
In the next book they'll add sister and brother parents, father with 3 wives and oprhans
Remember when bungie first added eververse in D1 and everyone freaked out but we where told that eververse was only there for bungie to make abit of side cash while they worked on dlcs, and everyone then told the people that freaked out that they where overreacting? Well this is why everone that freaked out freaked out, because it always starts off slow but after afew years it becomes the main focus of the game, sadly now we are at a point where bungie don't care how much we complain as long as the money keeps on flowing in they won't change a thing.
So if the farmers' economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country.
Fine and great, but just wait until the government requires citizens to take mandatory anti-depressants, so everyone is safer against suicidal terrorist attacks. Don't think it'll ever happen? Well no one would have thought mandatory vaccinations (or any other medical procedure) would be forced on citizens by the state either. This sets a worrying precedent, even if it's mostly a good idea....
Look man the worst things in history were done with the best intentions, Hitler though that he was saving the Germans by killing the Jews, or mau though that by killing the birds he would get more food for his people.   So saying that the government is doing everything for the better of humanity is kinda an oxymoron because government has a poor history of screwing over people.   What makes you think that with these new powers the government wont confiscat guns, or people with a certain ideology, or even people with the virus and put them into camps. But were just saving people, right?
And if you pass the big drug companies' bill, nothing will happen.
So which other essential employees should be able to walkout on their jobs? Would you be in favor of Drs and Nurses walking out? How about the janitors that clean the hospitals? Should nursing home staff be able to walkout and leave the elderly to die like they did in Spain?  If you live in a city it would mean you rely deeply on essential employees to show up.  Without grocery stores, pharmacies, truckers, cops, firefighters, EMS, paramedics, power/water/sewage employees, sanitation workers, gas stations, UPS, Amazon and Fedex.. the list goes on forever.. we are deeply reliant on these people to continue to show up or we are all fucked.
UBI can also be similar to modern slavery though. They can implement a system where you are forced to do certain things in order to get UBI - submit to continuous and invasive surveillance, get national ID cards used for everything, submit to social credit schemes, keep a clean criminal record, etc etc etc. And even if it doesn't start that way, it can easily head that way over 5, 10, 15 years and continue to get worse. In theory it's a great idea, but most of us don't trust the government to regulate itself enough for systems like this to work for the people.
We need to legalize meth next!
The perp's poems weren't even scheduled to be part of the proceedings. Stop forwarding a false narrative.  The anthology in question was years ago, and all this professor did was curate the collection and select the poems on quality. The perp's poems were just two out of 50+ poems in the anthology. The professor didn't commit the crime, wasn't involved in the crime, doesn't condone the crime, and has clearly been speaking on this topic for years.  How far does the guilt smearing go? Are we going to interfere with events on campus sponsored by local Hispanic students because the perp now lives in Mexico, and we cannot stomach that the Mexican government is allowing him to exist and work? How many degrees of separation do we need before we can be safe from being Cancelled  by the censorious mob?
Why stop there?
I hope everyone here arguing against this is okay with being detained by BPD for violating federal drug laws when they buy weed.
Don't like, don't read seems simple enough to me  Written fanfiction is probably the most harmless of problematic media.  And frankly I'm just glad that it's allowed to exist at all. Slippery slope arguments are shit and all, but once the policing starts it wont stop at the obvious problematic pairings with illegal age differences (is incest even considered a big issue anymore, what with GoT making it super popular on every porn site ever?), it'll continue on with other common but unfit for polite company kinks like non-consent and BDSM and then it'll come for queer pairings, and then it's women enjoying sex and at that point corporate will move in to make money off it  //edit: I want to make it clear that I'm not defending stories with pedophilic content, I'm just of the opinion there's worse issues (like the simulated child porn using 3d models that's so common nowadays) and that we have much more to lose than to gain by going down this road
Very sad to see Virginia starting down the path to authoritarianism. Not good.
I have a *very* hard time with this. I'm completely on board with churches *voluntarily* cancelling their own services... but if government can order churches to close their doors due to a public health emergency, what other emergencies might be invented in the future to justify suppression of our Constitutionally-guaranteed right to free exercise of religion -- *or other rights*?
Before: Why do you care what we do in our own bedrooms, it doesn't affect you.  Now: Eat the gay food. Use the gay bank. Watch the gay parades. Watch the gay TV shows. Play the gay games. Learn about gay history. Teach your kids about gay sex. Let drag queens read to your children. Let your sons wear dresses and take drugs to alter their biology.
Give an inch and theyll take a mile
The rational explanation is it's a very personal matter of women's health, and it leads to slippery slope territory when men, who are not medical professionals, try to track what's going on with our bodies.
Right so everything else should be free too ? I like the guy but let's be realistic
No.  2nd Ammendment. Throw that away and you throw away everything after. 3rd. 4th, 5th ...etc. I am cool with women voting.  As well as everything else. What do you want to give up?
I agree. This is an incredibly slippery slope and very dangerous line of thinking that could do significantly more harm than good. I understand what hes talking about in the video but I cant say I agree with him due to the way it could be abused
Great. Guns are banned! *Maybe* knife crime will creep up a little. We'll just ban knives too!  Great. Knives are banned! *Maybe* Assaults with weapons like clubs will creep up a little. We'll just ban sticks too!  Great. Sticks are banned! *Maybe* Assaults will creep up a little. We'll just ban physical movement too!  There. Everyone is safe.
Socialism is only a stepping stone to communism. Both are failures of the last century and killed more people and destroyed more cultures than fascism.
If this strike violates the terms of your existing labor contract, why would you expect the administration to even negotiate a new one with you? Its been shown you won't honor a contract that both parties signed in good faith. Why would UC trust you not to just strike again, for whatever reasons you deem fit, the minute the ink on the new one is dry?
Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to -- to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors.
Good for them, pushing sodomy on children is a slippery slope.
If we don't resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant.
It will cause the six-party talks to evaporate. It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons.
And if you enter bilateral talks, they'll be happy to walk away from the table.
Distracted driving is a HUGE problem but the fact that people are begging for a state run mass surveillance system is terrifying. It may seem innocuous and even helpful at first but the implications are tremendous. These are the first steps towards mass facial recognition and social credit systems... and people are clamoring for it. Its crazy.
Exactly this. They pay so little because water itself is free. Turning water into a commodity is a very slippery slope. Better to just stop buying the bottled water and let Nestle do its thing.      How can people think paying for oxygen is some dystopian nightmare but still campaign for Nestle to pay for the water they pump is crazy to me. Can you imagine seeing the value of water per litre being displayed next to things like gold, silver, and oil?
Having sex with children was the norm for thousands of years. There are just enough people in power now who know that shit's disgusting and wrong. But it seems to me to be a common enough thread throughout history to hardly be called a disease or anything. And saying these people need mental help would *absolutely* just have whataboutists start talking conversion therapy for *actual* GSRM folks.  How about pedophiles just don't fucking rape little kids? It's not god damn fucking hard to not rape people, or support child traffickers, or cp proliferators.
A total gun ban doesnt happen over night. It happens by chipping away at the 2nd amendment until theres nothing left. Small iterations seem like nothing at the time (especially to those who dont care about guns), but the fact is that gun rights are much weaker than they were 25 years ago.
I think they pretty clearly explained that people breaking the rules by using public tennis courts that have been closed, will lead to more extreme measures to keep parks closed.   Theres likely a excusable reason that this many people could be congregating together, the point is, they shouldnt be doing it at a public park thats been closed for health concerns. Even if theyre healthy and fine, breaking the rules leads to a precedent of everyone thinking their a special case and then the rules apply to no one.
That's exactly the road that we went down on after using that reason to justify the LGBT community. The exact same reason can be used to justify pedophilia.
And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse.
We should remove all fountains globally too, right? They must use a lot of electricity.  Actually dont festivals, concerts and sporting events use a ton of resources for a few hours of hedonistic joy? We should probably stop all of those too, so the money can be spent elsewhere (for instance).  Did I miss anything? /s
Because they definitely only want to go after the trans people and its definitely not the first step to surveillance and punish people in our community
If he were seeking to display a genuine concern in climate change, he'd find another way. But lets be serious. Climate change is a joke. It's merely a ploy for world government.
Pedophilia is a mental disorder/ailment. Just as some would classify homosexuality. Wasn't uncommon to hear homosexuals be called homophiles in older days. Pedophiles are this centuries homosexuals. Widely hated by all, yet 100 years ago the homosexuals would have been hated just as much. Now I'm not one to hate without reason, but you should consider these contrasts. It will provide knowledge on human social structures and insight as to how society changes its direction. In 100 years people will call themselves pedosexuals and to protest would be pedophobic haha.
The right to assemble is a civil liberty. If they take away one civil liberty? How many can the have? All of them?  Wrong place to post. But no one will let the truth be heard!!!
You know how you stop Confederate flags from showing up in Lansing?  You vote out anyone who was elected who displays it, and you shame any non-elected official/private person into changing their actions. Forcing the removal of a single symbol does nothing to address the feelings and thoughts behind it, and if anything, makes it easier to ferret out hate and address it.   This is besides the fact that once you start the b-ball rolling on governmental restrictions on free speech, it is only a matter of time before everyone gets squashed by it.
Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and we've got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently-which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we don't do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, we'll destroy their economies, destroy their future. And at the same time will destroy markets that are important to our farmers.
Sets bad precedent, tommorow future govts could do the same to opposition
We said it was a slippery slope and now we're falling further into degeneracy
Ya the the thing is if we give the government access theyll know they can so they keep taking more and more  Thats one of the arguments against gun laws, if we give them a foot theyll take a mile
Now, because the governor has all this money for a tax cut mostly to the wealthy, there is no money left over, so schools get testing and lawsuit reform and not much else.
I'd say nah because there's a huge grey area. oh so definitely we're taxing butter. White bread definitely, yeah the nice artisan French bread is included under that umbrella. All condiments we'll tax, ketchup is sugar and mayo is oil. Pickles too yeah, they're just pure sodium. Etc.
So... where are you going with this? First Weed. Now Legalise this?
Our children will not see the American dream because of this debt that somebody somewhere dropped on us.
It's amazing how accepting all of Reddit is to police and military walking the streets of the entire country to forcibly imprison everyone in their own homes.  Next we'll have damn tanks cruising down residential streets and ya'll will just say it's to keep the elderly safe of covid-19, it is worth it!
Comments on these always crack me up.  They are making money from us paying for Xbox live gold.  But that isnt enough....they have to plaster ads right on the damn home screen to make even more revenue.  And people are just fine with it.  Go play a game der der der.  So eventually well have an entire home screen full of ads and people will be good with that.  I could see it if you dont have gold, but for Christs sake
Do anti-vax parents of children barred from public school get a tax break for not receiving public services theyre paying in to? I think prohibiting use of public services is a slippery slope (I understand that slippery slope is often called a bad argument). Should we deny public police service from people who are anti police activists? What other groups of people who pay into the system should be denied service? I am not anti-vax by any means. Vasectomy to ensure never have to worry about kiddos, just a counter argument to see what people think about the act of denying public services to particular groups.
Slippery slope no? Considering the history of disabled people being killed or tortured or tested on or eliminated in Nazi fires or being sterilized or having limited or no rights or not having the right to make their own decision.  You are a stranger to history and science. Stop being one.
Everyone should 100% stay at home... but we also should be real damn careful about how much power we hand over not just to the government but large corporations and social media.  Censorship is a hell of a thing and a lot of really bad shit started with the best intentions.
Guess what? police need to interact with people at close quarters. they often need to touch or grapple. The masks do little. Cool it. Once they wear masks your anxiety will force you to demand the next step. biohazard suits? get real.
Because when you do not tax, and tax enough to pay for your outgo, you pay it many times over in higher prices and inflation;
Do you think CPD will let us decorate our stars of David patches they inevitably use to categorize drug buyers? Pardon if this offensive comparison is too much. I'm a strong believer that it's only a slippery slope away from my extreme comparison.
Maybe now that we have bank withdrawal and equip options, people will be more lax about it.
Not OP but there is a slippery slope argument that genetic modifications will lead to new age eugenics. Removing Huntington disease is one thing, but it's not difficult to see how some might use it to remove what they consider inferior traits.  Ther is also the fear that since distribution of technology typically is made to rich and affluent first, a generation of rich superhumans (for lack of a better term) would be born before he technology becomes available to society at large.
This is the equivalent of if we let gays marry, what's to stop people from marrying their dog? Were smarter than that arnt we?
The problem with this approach if taken too far is that by the time those 5th graders reach my college class they believe the whole world revolves around them.  Sadly, it doesnt.  Far better to find out and address whats between those 5th graders getting their work done on time.
All of these comments about how good it is for non-Chinese gamers... Those people should reconsider their priorities. I don't like hackers in my games either, but I am far more concerned about authoritarian surveillance laws that affect the lives of millions of people and further divide a global community that needs to work together and keep each other accountable for our actions. THAT's the news here. This isn't even a gaming subreddit.   How would you feel if your government took away your right to communicate with Canadians, or Scots, Aussies or maybe people from the neighboring state or province? For fear you might learn how they think, or feel, or act? Put a curfew on when you can access entertainment?   You should stand up for their human rights, even if some of them are jerks, or yours might be next.
yeah. Right now it may not be much, but the horse armor wasnt also much. Now we have to pay for every unfinished game and for the DLC to complete it.   You can downvote me also for an opinion kids, but I quote you when we have to pay for every mon and every arena in 3 years. Its not about having money or not, its about paying for features that should be included.
I'm strongly pro choice but if the government can outlaw demonstrations and protests is a slippery slope towards infringing basic rights l.
Reading everyone's comments has made me change my opinion on having an adventure mode like thing in PoE. I keep seeing if an adventure mode needs to exist then why not just start a char at 68. then a couple months after that we'll see post about how people want to start at 90 just so they can kill bosses. Then a few months later we'll see people asking for a creative mode so they can have access to all items in the game so they don't have to farm, and i dont think that sets a good example as a community for a game that we all love.
First you'll argue premartital sex is not a sin and then you'll argue abortion is not a sin because you'll want to kill a baby you made in one of your whores.  Sin just keeps balooning.
Yes, and if we're going to convict nurses and doctors of murder for being overwhelmed, we should also be convicting members of the public who are flouting the warnings and rules put in place to stem the spread, as well as the politicians and talking heads who downplay the seriousness of the virus.  This is a public failure of our systems, for which we are collectively guilty.
Funny how after they regulated seat direct ammo sales all of a sudden they can impose new laws.
And I think you get a certain arrogance, bureaucratic arrogance, if people stay there too long.
Not that bad compared to some of the other shit on this sub. But memes like this can be a gateway drug to deeper depravity.
Ok, lets go along with you and say its unfair to impose these restrictions on 17 year olds. How about 15 year olds, can they drink, smoke and buy guns, how about 13 year olds? Why stop at teenagers, what about 9 year olds who are super mature?  This isnt unpopular, its just ill conceived teenage entitlement.
We should do that with personally owned houses. Take them from you and donate them to homeless people. Or at least force you to share living accommodations.  Also - Your food, water, medicine, transportation, toilet paper, toys, money, etc.
And let's take the money that we've been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools. We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright but America's future is going to bright as well.
If we start going after tankies then people will see it as an excuse to purge SocDems and even DemSocs, then we'll lose all of our momentum. This has been the fate of all big leftist political movements in the west for the last fifty years.   Resist the urge to antagonize any part of the left for the time being. That can come after we actually accomplish something.
It's a slippery slope to communism,  as well as it not working very well as an economic system in general
Why stop there?  I could just as easily argue that the existence of millionaires and thousandaires is a policy failure.  But praytell, just what policy by a legit political party, ie not the Commies or the Furries or whatever are you referring to?
There are so many people saying What's the harm?, it's not him specifically but when you let one person surf or do whatever, then you begin to have an issue where people see this person out and allowed to do something, then it just invites more people to do the same, or cry for inequality because he's allowed on the beach and they are not. What makes him exempt from the rules?   Slaps on the wrist aren't doing it as we have people still going out and ignoring warnings. Honestly I thought this was a post from /r/Justiceporn
2014: Bake that cake!  2019: Wax those balls!  2020: Date that psycho!
The bill is a separate measure from House Bill 64, which is a proposed corporate income tax on companies with over 100 shareholders. House Bill 147 would impose a four percent income tax on earnings over $200,000.  Ey, I could probably get behind this.  Let's make all those billionaires in Teton county pay the bills.  On the other hand, I know slopes are slippery and if you give a bear a pancake, he ganna ask for syrup.
2012 We just want to get married and have the same rights as everyone else!  Ok. Of course that's neccessary.  2017 Children should be transitioned as soon as possible. Parents who interfere should be charged with child abuse!!!  No hold on...  2020 Your children should be watching BBC porn and we'll moderate with a FAQ board that totally isn't filled with perverted pedophiles grooming your children.  ...  Yea no slippery slope whatsoever. Nope. Shit like this is why trump's gonna win again.
i agree with you 100% , but if we keep accepting these adjustments to every pass then we will be back to the old way it was . the only reason the passes have gotten better is because player base spoke up and thats why we are getting more stuff out of the pass , not out of riot's kind heart
If you allow complex bans, you can 'complex ban' almost anything from any tier, with no real clear limit. If Aegislash is Ubers but without king's shield it is OU is possible, why not Zacian is Ubers but without these X moves it's OU? Tiers would cease to really mean anything: the only difference between tiers would be the arbitrary line where mons can be ran as they are.  Additionally, banning debates would get an additional layer of complexity, as they're no longer about *whether* to ban but *what* to ban. If corviknight is overpowered, can we best balance it by removing its ability to run pressure? Bulk up? Substitute?
And those 2 people will go home to their families of 1, 2, 3 whatever. Then if these 2 are ignoring the rules, they are probably too. Now they're going to their friends houses. Then they're going to their friends houses.  Now just 2 people together means hundreds have come into contact with one another
See? This is the kind of crap that gets bred from moral relativism. If you believe youre a random assembly of atoms and attraction is a chemical reaction, and that acting on that attraction is just stardust bumping into stardust... then anything goes, eventually. Messed up!!
Probably violating some kind of governors order or law about price gouging and not having a license or something. He didnt hoard them for himself and probably got caught trying to sell them.
Jesus you guys are actually beyond saving at this point. Time to sit back and watch The Left on it's slippery slope to good ole Communism, enjoy your famine.
First stop cannabis, next is MDMA followed by Speed, then Ice, and finally legalising Heroin.  What could possibly go wrong?  Oh right, kids may not know how to inject safely.  So we must teach primary school kids how to safely inject themselves.  It's also best to give first time users a taste while under supervision, so supervised injections for kids until they can do it safely on their own.  This will all be a win for human rights.  Nothing could possibly go wrong.
This is cool and all, but I'm glad it's not being passed in a country where I live.  If you give the government *any* control over what is considered hate speech, you are basically relinquishing your freedom of speech. It's a slippery slope.  For example: saying hateful things about Islam becomes illegal. Let's say you criticise Sharia laws (laws based off of the rules set out in Islam for those who are unaware). Next thing you know, your own government has full power to censor this hate, and you are persecuted simply for disagreeing with the laws of an ally nation.  Governments have shown time and time again that they are more than happy to censor and abuse their peoples. Don't ever relinquish your freedoms willingly.
It will annoy and irritate the BLM and local law enforcement and put future permits at risk.
The problem with testing is that it's probably left to the states to implement, and they can make it *de facto* impossible to pass (or possibly even sit the exam), or worse, allow preferential treatment/make it prohibitively expensive to accomplish and therefore accomplish a gun ban.  For example, let's say there's a class, but there's 10 people in the entire state (Let's say, California) that are allowed to teach the class, it takes two weeks, and you can't teach more than 50 people at time. Also, it costs $800 to take, meaning you lock out a lot of people that can't afford.
For those who can't understand....  Countries are starting to abort any abnormality nearly 100% if the time (check Iceland autism). Even if you think that's a good thing (which many would strongly disagree) you must concede that it is a slippery slope towards eugenics.
Ew no thanks, soon they'll be doing the same with bats and dogs because certain people do it too.
No guys you dont understand. Communism is just what happens when they take socialism too far. Bernie is totally gonna stop at just the right amount of socialism. Just like they stopped at background checks for firearm purchases, and same sex marriage. And border control. And pretty much every single thing theyve ever done. Sorry, but any time theyre given an inch, they take a mile. Im not giving any more ground to the left.
But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and we'll go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome - thank God for the United States on that one.
I dont get it. Should they also be required to sell their businesses if they sit on committees or vote on legislation which will affect them? Maybe we should also make them exempt from paying federal taxes since they write the tax laws.   Should we also pass laws that say state and local government officials cant own property in the areas under their jurisdiction so they cant make property tax or zoning laws which benefit them?
Distracted driving is a HUGE problem but the fact that people are begging for a state run mass surveillance system is terrifying. It may seem innocuous and even helpful at first but the implications are tremendous. These are the first steps towards mass facial recognition and social credit systems... and people are clamoring for it. Its crazy.
It's a slippery slope to censorship. Loathe or like him, free speech is becoming more &amp; more under threat on social media. Who's next and who decides?
Either separate by gender or stop using gender to separate.  Really that simple.  If Dick and identify as Jane, then why can't 30yr old Dick identify as 14yr old Dick and claim he should be allowed to go to school?  If gender isn't science, then age shouldn't be either.  The only people who lose out are the ones with actual medical abnormalities that make gender ambiguous...lost out to people with raging, unchecked mental illness and a society that once again ignores the mentally ill.
The truth of that matter is, if you listen carefully, Saddam would still be in power if he were the president of the United States, And the world would be a lot better off.
Slippery slope to have youtube start removing documentaries based on what they want you to see.  Odds are they would remove the ones you dont want them to remove.
Americans need to stop willingly giving up their freedoms. We are on a very slippery slope. Just because you have nothing to hide doesnt mean the government has the right to know everything.
I understand why people would be upset with this guy, but the FBI coming to your house and taking your shit? Get ready America this is just the beginning of regulating every bit of our lives
A little bit of gun control here,  another 15% tax,  A little bit of a reform to make it so you cant sell firearms inside of city limits.   what part of shall not be infringed arent ya getting?  enforce the laws that exist, hold domestic abusers accountable, provide mental health care. close the private sales loophole on background checks.
yeah, and all that is great until the wealth tax gets extended to the middle-class  just like the income tax was  be careful what you wish for
Yup. That is pretty fucking disgusting I agree . That's like almost a porn ad in public space.
If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby .
Tomorrow, Afghanistan will be voting for a president. In Iraq, we'll be having free elections, and a free society will make this world more peaceful.
Legitimate issue with Sanders. Hard to believe European social democrats would have nice things to say about Fidel Castro. Sanders really is hard-left, not just regular left.  Sanders line of arguing here is a slippery slope. Need more examples to illustrate how slippery it is?  Hitler built the Autobahn. Is that a bad thing? It's an amazing road network, and so fun to drive  Nazis sucked, but their uniforms were hot  The Soviet Union was brutal, but hey, at least everyone had a job  Sure China is a dictatorship, but they've had so much economic success  &#x200B;  It is a classic move to defend the indefensible.  &#x200B;  Sometimes, even HW is worth quoting. He said:  We know what works. Freedom Works. We know what's right. Freedom is right.  compare that to   Yea, but they have a literacy program ...
The minute we have bilateral talks, the six-party talks will unwind.
And we are well onto the slippery slope. >Triggers are the same as callouts they're fine  >Auto placing waymarks is fine you still have to know what you're doing  >Telling you your spot for limit cut/wormhole is fine there's so much to remember and you still have to execute  >Seeing AoEs is fine you still have to dodge them  Where will it end?  What's next?
And if it won't come down, the economy's going to slow down, maybe go into a recession.
That still sets a dangerous precedent though. If spells work, maybe alternative medicine does too? Who needs vaccines when we have snake oil? We should never promote stupidity. It only leads to further harm.
Yes they are... Simple as they seem, giving this up now. Where does the line get drawn, how far will you let them go.
Cool. In fact, in the interests of being culturally sensitive, maybe I should learn all their words and only use their language when talking with them. I'd only be required to learn a few hundred languages, right?     (Stupidest thing I've read all day).
He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation .  Now, here's what that means .  It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented .  And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country .
Collecting the genetic blueprints of people in immigration detention doesn't make us safer  it makes it easier for the government to attack immigrant communities, and brings us one step closer to the government knocking on all of our doors demanding our DNA under the same flawed justification that we may one day commit a crime, Naureen Shah, senior advocacy and policy counsel with the ACLU said in a statement.  Yea that sounds kinda dangerous to limited government
First it's explosives and other tactical tools.  Then it's full auto and selective burst firing.  Then it's semi-auto rifles.  Then all guns are banned.  It's a slippery slope.
and this is how it begins  we should come up with some kind of social credit system too, where if you don't comply to the hysterical mob, you will have no feasible existence in this world, that'll show 'em
I wonder how long until pedophilia is legal.
People dont get that censoring something that is unacceptable in like 1/3 of the world is opening flood gates to censoring everything a large group of people hate... which would pretty much delete all kind of expression both good and bad.
Well if 10 minutes isnt bad, then surely 11 is ok.   If 11 is ok then 13 is fine.   If 13 is fine then whats wrong with 15.   You said 15 is ok, 16 is just a minute more.   Were at 16, Im finishing up and will be checked out by 18.   See how it keeps getting stretched out?????  When the goddamned sign says the store closes at 9:00 the fucking customers need to get the fuck out by 8:59. They had all day to get their shit taken care of.  At 9 0 0 youre on my time.
whew, now we just call anyone we don't like a nazi and we can genocide them     woah there buddy, are you enjoying movies by primarily white actors... you know what that makes you...
And if he had been in power, in other words, if we would have said, Let the inspectors work, or let's, you know, hope to talk him out. Maybe an 18th resolution would work, he would have been stronger and tougher, and the world would have been a lot worse off. There's just no doubt in my mind we would rue the day, had Saddam Hussein been in power.
The problem, Mr. Bush, is that you've cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income. And when you do that, you've have homeless families.
And if we don't act today, the problem will be valued in the trillions.
Great idea on the quick chats but paying for it only opens the gates for more useful add ons to have a price which potentially turns this game into a pay to win kinda thing. I only say that because I think this idea would be a strategic game changer. Kickoffs would be more predictable for the teammate with more options to access the situation. They should just throw these in the game.   Also in addition to your highly impressive list of quick chats, they should add a third button to be pressed before making a quick chat. Not sure if that's the best way to explain it but, instead of pressing up up for Nice one! press up three times. That would allow for more options a player has for chat. Probably too many options but it's not a polished idea yet.
A prime example of the importance of free speech.  &gt; Oh, but we only want to outlaw hate-speech, not free speech. &gt;  &gt; Does hate-speech include insulting the King? &gt;  &gt; Uhh...  EDIT:  If you guys dont think the definition of hate-speech will always be written by the powerful, to favor the powerful, you need to read history.
Isn't this what they said about gays and trans before they were legalised. It will inevitably happen with pedos, I saw it coming.
She is spreading misinformation. Soon people are gonna do this instead of using real medicine. Thats the harm
And when we're weak at home - weaker than all our allies - that weakness weakens the whole free world.
Look man I like Bernie as much as the next guy and Im no fan of CNN but /r/politics is going fucking crazy. Theres a way to be critical of the media without conspiracy theories and victim complexes. This is the kind of slippery slope that leads to bullshit like the Jewish question.
And it is one of the things I've learned in the White House, is that there's enormous pressure on the president, and he cannot wilt under that pressure. Otherwise, the world won't be better off.
I think it's a free speech issue. Any argument, short of personal insult (because then it's no longer a debate) should be allowed. If we ban one type of argument because you think it's abhorrent, then we have to ban argument type b because someone else is offended. This is a debate sub. We should argue against that sort of thing, not ban it altogether.
Millions of people should starve on the street so thousands dont die from the flu. And Im the ignorant one.
nobody is arguing its not effective. people are arguing that this is an attempt to increase government control and that this is just the beginning. of course many people will agree with this because its about children. but tomorrow it will be about your neighbour who was deemed by the government to be a domestic terrorist because he dared criticize the government, and it will be your job to report him and if you dont, you will be punished
This is why foreigners are warned, you watch right now. Some of the Chinese are gonna turn on anyone. Black, Hispanic, white or south Asian.  Get the hell out now.  How far will the CCP go? Start gunning down any suspects on the streets or in their homes?  They've already got the people turning on each other.
If you normalize forced government injections what happens when the government turns against it's own people like governments have for all of recorded history?  What injections might they force on people in the future 'for their own good'?
There wouldn't be time for a President to decide; it would be decided by these remote computers. It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it's a missile -- and off we go.
because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos.
From what I remember (from a history class) there was concern at the time that passing the ERA would outlaw gendered bathrooms. But even if that isn't true, if the ERA had passed, it most *definitely* would have been interpreted as mandated taxpayer funded abortion up to birth in all 50 states. It doesn't matter that Paul and Eastman didn't intend it that way.
I'm still against it. If it's not restricted to a man and a women, what's the purpose? Why not make a contract between *n* people who live together.
The guy is an idiot, but he shouldn't be fired. Free speech is way more important than this guy or any other idiot. Tolerating idiots doesn't lead to authoritarianism, but dismantling liberal values in the name of fear does.
Going to get downvoted,but just follow my logic here and let's see where it goes.  But if they weren't in school, and they were at home... right? Then who would be responsible for feeding them? Would that be their parents? And if their parents were at home, instead of at work making money, then how would they afford the rent, clothes, food, etc?  School is a free babysitter for the working class, but not a free lunch. If you can't afford to make a salami sandwich for your kid and send it with him to school, then you can't afford to make him one at home, right?   I'm not saying that the  public education system couldn't be asked to provide lunches, but it definitely shouldn't be expected. With that same logic, why don't we provide parents free lunch at work, and homeless people need free lunches too. The argument for free stuff only ends poorly.
R/childfree started as a support group for people being pressured by family to have kids.   It has turned into another hate group.   They hate kids and people who have kids.   And its getting worse.   It wont be long before they will start encouraging violence against kids, if they havent already.
If we start including things that aren't orientations or gender identities, there's no way to stop the pedos claiming they're covered too.
Where do you draw the line? No one has provided a decent way of explaining how fines should be given out. Let's walk down Spadina and fine every homeless person for not self quarantining.   &amp;#x200B;  Jesus Christ
We don't have total free speech. You can't incite a panic or slander. And hate speech laws in placed like Canada only prevent you from advocating for genocide based on race or gender. Do you have a problem with not advocating for genocide?
Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor's life with a gun will understand that that's not the way America is meant to be.
I also look forward to when you can bring in infinite ammounts of money into your raid, your character has to shit every 12 hours, your character sleeps at least 8 hours a day or gets a debuff, you lose the game permanently if you die, painkillers and vaseline become obsolete because they don't  actually help when your limbs have literally been shot out, when you have to see your therapist 2 times a week for your PTSD appointments, when they remove levels and skills and your character rolls a random set of skills based on his previous employment and where he went to school, when they  abandon the fantasy world of Tarkov to make way for the real world inspired map: Boise, Idaho.  &amp;#x200B;  Better not complain, adapt to the realistic environment.
Censorship always starts with something most people agree with.  Thats how you get buy in.
>This is wrong. Pedophiles do not choose to be attracted to children. That's a fact. As long as they do not hurt a child (or promote/support doing so ie: child porn) they have done nothing wrong and deserve no condemnation.  **Ohhh another pedo sympathizer...**   >Guys, this is r/TumblrInAction, I really thought we were beyond thoughtcrime.  When is about silly shit yeah... When is about grown men wanting to fuck kids but restraining themselves, well, thats another matter.   >You don't need to hunt them down to protect the children. Reasonable restrictions, therapy and a watchful adult are enough. Not wanting to kill them for what they think/feel is NOT a slippery slope, it's basic decency.  It is a slippery slope. You stop watching that guy for a minute and he will ruin the live of someone just because it's basic decency.  **There are lines you don't cross.**
Soon it will be those over 70 then over 60 etc.  Once you cross the line, its all downhill from there
You're forgetting, if you give Liverpool the mathematically uncertain title, then 3-5 start claiming Champions League and Top 2 in Championship claim promotion. Giving 1 thing that is not confirmed at the top is causing a massive snowball affect further down. You either give *everything* or *nothing*
Maybe the government can tell you what color underwear and in what style you should wear, also?  Or require everyone to wear burkas, and clan turbans?  Or just decide that driving a vehicle that has more than 182hp is too unsafe for you?  Or that owning your own locking safe at home is a suspicious activity, unless you give the combination to your local police?  Or that voting is just too dangerous since no one can guarantee the right person will be elected?  Or that your gender, race, sexual orientation, beliefs, or religion should decide where you can shop?    America has lost the meaning of civil liberties, and we should all be upset about it. The government, nor the bureaucrats in it, are not your friend.
ok but can I just say - no his doesn't sound familiar.  The left is asking for expanding background checks, closing the gun show loop hole, maybe registering firearms and creating a system that addresses or catches strawman purchases.   We don't need to play this strawman argument game.  And we don't need to do the slippery slope thing either.  Reasonable regulations doesn't lead to the fed keeping lists and someday coming after all gun owners to suppress the working class.
&gt; CENSORSHIP  Literally yes it would be. Suppression of communication on the basis that's harmful. That our government is working together with reddit should really be more of a concern.
...and who makes the determination that it was natural causes? Someone qualified would have to do that, since self-induced abortions can look like miscarriages.  What the OP is essentially stating is that if you really believe that abortion must be treated as murder, then you are also arguing for other more potentially ominous things you may have not really thought of.
the slow process of mask slipping:  actually i'm a paleoconservative, i just think that modern conservatives are too supportive of israel  and they spend too much time trying to prove they aren't racist when they won't stand up for white people  and REAL conservatives don't accept lgbt people   and the holocaust was clearly overstated
Alright, so to build a tower, why not fix the foundation for 10 years before building the tower? That sounds like the right way going forward and what Massive is doing.   Sure, its going to compound problems, but that's exactly why we have Division 2, Destiny 2, and multiple releases of games. Everything is going to fall apart sooner or later as complexity increases, and thinking you could fix the foundation perfectly to avoid magnifying the problems is just hoping that the Sun don't grow into a red giant sooner or later.
Well, yeah.   But the issue I have with it is not really the guns themselves. It's the actual removal of Constitutional Right. Remove one and they will keep going.   They love to bring out the Slippery Slope isn't real argument, though. While having absolute evidence of the contrary. Another argument they love to bring out is Yeah but they already amended the Constitution with the Prohibition!.   It's a bit infuriating.
No you didn't?  It is literally an item handed to you by claptrap while following the DLC2 main story quest line.  You can farm it by resetting your playthrough and running through the DLC again, that is the only way to get it.  Or you can savescum your save file to farm it, but that is a slippery slope to me down the path of modding gear and cheating, so I don't do it.
And the worst part is, he will get caught, he will suffer consequences for it, and it wont deter him, it will only push him to commit increasingly risky crimes. This is how a career criminal gets their start, thinking theyre smarter than everyone else and like theyre beating the system. I knew a bakers dozen kids like him growing up, and Id say half of them are serving life sentences.     Shoplifting -> commercial burglary -> residential burglary -> robbery -> armed robbery -> murder
I get what OP is saying but this is the definition of a slippery slope. Humans are by and large the only species on this planet who not only love, but also care for the weak (promise I don't mean that in a bad way).  Lions don't have a support group to prop up one of them that is injured or gets a thorn in their paw. They say fuck em and leave them to fix it themselves, or die.  Humans are beautiful *because* we shield, care for, and protect the outliers of our family/society.  I don't want to invoke Godwin's Law but OP's opinion is skirting dangerously close to being fanatical. If implemented, would undoubtedly be used as a baseline that would quickly morph into exterminating anyone who doesn't contribute to society, or in other words, be a burden.  Paraplegic but still have all of your cognoscent facilities? Gandpa has alzheimers? Welp, you don't contribute to society and are a 24 hour burden, toss them in the pile.
You may think these are extreme examples.  And yes they probably are!  But there is a psychological effect called foot in the door, once you head down a road at what point do you stop?  The easiest option for quick information/imposing rules is to assume its not ok and work backwards from there.  - dont lean over anyone when having a conversation, pull up a chair - if you see someone from work outside the traditional setting follow their lead with engaging or not. - dont say anything to a woman that you wouldnt want a guy to whisper to you.  Yes its hard to understand why you a normal guy could come across as inappropriate, but the fact is the nicest guy in the world can overstep unintentionally.  Protect yourself, your career/business and your colleagues. Be mindful
Yall do realize they are seizing private property, right? The rabbit hole that this leads down and the near blindness everyone seems to have here is fuckin staggering.
I don't think it's overkill. It sends the message clearly. They aren't fucking around anymore. Why does this man think he is allowed to surf while most people who are quarantined are stuck inside their homes. What if every quarantined person thought like he did. You would have a problem on your hands.
Why doesnt everyone contribute 100% of everything they make and everything they have to taxes. From there the government can fund all of the social programs we need and then distribute out the necessities of life according to what each individual person needs. Stupid conservatives.
I think that what -- I think the point of that is that anybody would have a hard time trying to make a tax cut plan that is so large, that would put us into such big deficits, that gives almost half the benefits to the wealthiest of the wealthy.
This administration, by going into the Star Wars system, is going to add a dangerous new escalation.
I don't see the problem. When the government says stay home, stay home. When the government says hands up, hands up. When the government says walk to Oklahoma, walk. When the government says get in the internment camp, get. When the government says get in the boxcar, get. It's for the common good, idiot.
The potential for abuse would be enormous.  It would be like the old Roman grain allotments.  If the UBI is set at $500 a month, then all a politician would have to do to be wildly popular is promise to expand it to $1000.  Then $2000, 3000, 10000.  And you *KNOW* that's exactly what would happen, because, like I said, there's perfect historical precedent.  It's incredibly easy for politicians to bribe the electorate with their own money.
NTA. You told her the facts then she got upset. I'd have told her to take a hike and see a therapist. Really, if you entertain everybody's discomfort then society eventually breaks down. Sometime the problem is the individual so they need to fix their psychological problem.
The rational explanation is it's a very personal matter of women's health, and it leads to slippery slope territory when men, who are not medical professionals, try to track what's going on with our bodies.
Yeah, he seems like a fairly rational guy but Im not a fan of UBI. After thats in place, every president will claim theyre going to increase it 10%, 50% 300% vote for me free money. Once its part of the economy theres no going back. You cant remove a thousand dollars a month from people.
Lunacy?  Allow me to introduce you to my friend.  His name is reductio ad absurdum.  If you want to be tested for every infectious disease that exists (there are many thousands), every day of your life, you think that should be free?  Now that rhetorical question is burned to the ground by it's logical counterpoint, I await an actual good faith question.
If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, there's no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world.
Maybe they could also have the enemies kill themselves in exterminate missions by default,  and maybe make it to where we don't have to level anything,  all frames and all mods just start at max level by default.
&gt; Turns out our scientists are pretty fucking important after all.  *For want of a wage the postdoc was starved;*  *For want of a postdoc the lab was lost;*  *For want of a lab the vaccine was lost;*  *For the failure of vaccine the kingdom was lost*  *All for the want of a livable wage.*
You have to be very naive to think romantic prefrences does not transfer into other aspects of life.  I'm sorry but someone who would not date Hispanics for example, is also far more likely to not hire them for a high paying job ect. I just don't believe someone can ONLY pick and choose racially as far as romance is concerned and be completely fair in other more important aspects of life.  If you have a romantic prefrence you are more likely to discriminate (pick and choose) in other ways as well
I'd say nah because there's a huge grey area. oh so definitely we're taxing butter. White bread definitely, yeah the nice artisan French bread is included under that umbrella. All condiments we'll tax, ketchup is sugar and mayo is oil. Pickles too yeah, they're just pure sodium. Etc.
Sure.  In fact, that other guy is probably more romantic than you anyways.  Let him take your wife on a 2 week vacation while he dicks her down.  And he's more of an alpha male than you anyways, so go ahead and let him raise the kids.  He's probably better at work so quit and let him take your job.  Since you're an inferior male, you should probably save all that food for the alphas so they can stay strong.  They could use your room too.   World oxygen is at a decline so you should probably stop breathing since betas shouldn't breed anyways.
We just wanted to get married led to this.
I would like it on a handheld. If only Sony didnt stop productions and creations of handheld devices. Switch is the next best thing I guess but I dont want it for Switch. People act so crazy over it and a person I saw online actually sent a death threat in a mountain of curses demanding P5 be for Switch. Im not up for giving someone what they want if they act like that. Their attitudes would get worse if you give into their demands.
And I believe this Administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years, that our power relative to that of the Communists is declining, that we're facing a very hazardous time in the sixties, and unless the United States begin to move here - unless we start to go ahead - I don't believe that we're going to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom.
If he gets elected president, we'll start the new century without anyone in the cabinet of the President representing education in our children.
You know the day we start giving people sentences based on What other people got, you're going to find some stupid shit happening.  You know people have gotten away with murder, right?  Kind of a slope of idiocy you're preparing to sled down.
Yall do realize they are seizing private property, right? The rabbit hole that this leads down and the near blindness everyone seems to have here is fuckin staggering.
I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a - be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control - all the things that we do not want.
Grad students are part of the union and that union agreed to terms with the UC system. What is stopping students from other UC schools from breaking the agreement and striking over anything else? From the perspective of the UC administration, do you see how caving to the UCSC strike would open the door to further wildcat strikes?
I can see how this is a touchy subject.  Regardless of what you hear there are risks to vaccinations. They are incredibly rare though and in my opinion, it is worth the vaccination.   The problem is being forced into this. Should we force child limits if the population grows too fast?  Should people with a genetic predisposition to violence be allowed to have children or should they be sterilized to protect the majority?  I dont have kids and dont know how I would feel about this kind of requirement.   As a single person with no kids I would obviously prefer to have all children vaccinated so that I dont get sick :)
I would just ask if it's really worth it. The problem we have is that people are trying to find any way possible to find a loophole. You guys playing on an empty field might well be responsible and move on etc but really, it risks encouraging others rather than anything.  I would just say don't bother for now, I get that's crap, but it's unique times and just exercising and keeping moving is also part of our way of respecting the situation we are in rather than trying to beat the system on everything.  Edit: oh dear the selfish squad are down voting again, you must only focus on your every need and ignore what's actually happening.
Such a popular yet SO twisted opinion to have if you think about the potential and abuse this could lead to long term. People can basically justify alot of crazy stuff using that.
There's still fewer people in uniform today, but person-to-person, person-by-person, unit-by-unit, this is the most powerful and effective military, not only in the world today, but in the history of the world.
Who would think that once a religious group got a foot in the door of the public school (as a physical fitness program),  ...... that they would illegally use that opportunity to spiritually proselytize?  /s
If we're not an economic superpower, we're a used to be and we will no longer be a force for good throughout the world.
I think because giving in to a mob mentality is incredibly dangerous. How many people must the mob be before people must bend to their will?  Today it's a star on the street someone doesn't like.  Next it's a neighbor on a street that people want moved. I've seen first hand how these things grow fast. If you don't like Trumps politics - vote him out. Acting out / having a tantrum on his star achieves nothing.
Getting 12k is 1.5-2h of grinding.  You screwed up. Nobody decided that training TV Def was a good idea but you.   I don't see any reason why there should be any leeway here.   What's next? People being allowed to refight a luma because they accidentally killed it / ran from it?    Re-picking your starter because you decided you made the wrong decision?   Reverse a breeding process because people forgot to put a strain in?   Why not just implement a safe feature if you cater to the carelessness of people
Why? They can't keep people out of their games because of their beliefs, no matter how horrible they are. If they did, it would be a suppression of free speech.  They CAN do it, because they're a private company. But they shouldn't, because that shit is a slippery slope.
It is a process. Restrict one civil liberty, restrict all civil liberties. Look up the first they came poem, that perfectly entails in situation.
If you put too many limits on the match maker, then you get increase queues.  With increased queues, you lose players. When you lose players, you lose money.  When WoT losses money, they put in new features ... like wheelies to drive revenue.  And the downward spiral is repeated.    They already show what is in the queue, so the light tank people could take some personal responsibility and cancel out / change tanks if they see the queue has waaaaaay to many light tanks in it.  No .. that is not going to happen, the only recourse is for WoT to give us longer queues and the further decline of the game.  Just saying ...
Why would another grown adult need permission from another grown adult to do something to their own body?   Where does it stop?
Im for it, but the thing is i think ppl womt like it because where would we stop? First to cure diseases, then it might be to choose apperance and strenghts  Althou im all for it i understand why others might not
If we blame parents for their children becoming serial killers, why stop there? DUI? Blame the parents for creating an alcoholic child. Bank robber? Blame the parents for not instilling values in their child. Wife beater? Best get those parents on trial for not teaching their child how to treat women.  I don't see that as being the answer.
We heard Senator Kerry say the other night that there ought to be some kind of global test before U.S. troops are deployed preemptively to protect the United States. That's part of a track record that goes back to the 1970s when he ran for Congress the first time and said troops should not be deployed without U.N. approval. Then, in the mid-'80s, he ran on the basis of cutting most of our major defense programs. In 1991, he voted against Desert Storm.  It's a consistent pattern over time of always being on the wrong side of defense issues.
Thats how it starts... next thing you know were being scored on things like how polite we are in public settings.
Plus, I firmly believe that when vaxes become mandated--and it seems to be a matter of 'when' rather than 'if, given the number of bills being introduced/debated/voted on to eliminate ALL objections (conscientious, religious, philosophical)--then it'll only be a matter of time before other medical procedures are mandated as well.    When the government mandates what goes IN you, they'll mandate what comes OUT of you.
&gt;If we ban a card that impacts only a small number of players, what will those players ask for next?   This is a valid concern but I've never seen the cEDH community ask for a ban before. They'll question why useless things are banned or wonder what a cEDH driven ban list might look like, but Flash/Hulk/Oracle is the only serious push I've seen for a ban.
I called it years ago as lgbt rights were being established. Next is having relationships with your pets. Those that think no way, its already brewing in the background.
I guess we should forget about all white heritage. I mean, Sir John A McDonald statues have already been torn down and destroyed... first steps on a very slippery slope... how long before being Caucasian isnt tolerated because pioneers were bad.  White shaming and white guilt is already a daily occurrence thats for some reason accepted, as is racism towards whites.   Lets see how much this gets downvoted.
The President's economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way. But we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path.
Many companies are voluntarily doing just that.  Dont need another law FORCING people to comply.   Be careful. Youre going to end up in a totalitarian state if you keep pushing governmental force.
Because they were being pieces of shit - and this kind of intolerance is what ultimately leads to deep prejudice  and in lots of cases physically manifests in violence and even genocide. Why the fuck should we allow behavior like that to continue?
If we had not taken our initiative, it's very, very possible that uh - the government of Rhodesia would have been overrun and that the Soviet Union and the Cubans would have dominated uh - southern Africa.
Oh you are so selfish, I think we should also demand free snacks and food as a worker's right, oh, what else, umm, I'd also like 2-day workweek but the salary should stay the same or increase, also if we want to live in a civilized world, every worker should have a right to demand his/her favorite food for free from the employer every single day, in my case it's [Lobiani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobiani)
Numerous administrations going back certainly to World War II have had to wrestle with the problem of what should happen to the Middle East.
Mass surveillance and tracking of people by mobile data if they have Covid-19? Hard pass.
Its a slippery slope. Next theyll be raiding your house because you have to much food. Then theyll need your ammo and guns.
That's a great way for us to lose the game all together.
Well, yeah.   But the issue I have with it is not really the guns themselves. It's the actual removal of Constitutional Right. Remove one and they will keep going.   They love to bring out the Slippery Slope isn't real argument, though. While having absolute evidence of the contrary. Another argument they love to bring out is Yeah but they already amended the Constitution with the Prohibition!.   It's a bit infuriating.
Well they should have the option to take it or not. As soon as you make vaccines mandatory my fear is the government will make other health procedures mandatory.   Dont get me wrong, I think vaccines are great and people should get them. But I do not think it would be wise to make vaccines mandatory.
There is a progression to these things. Eventually you end up with an entirely non-transparent censorship system suitable for purely political uses.
Using one handers is not the same as transmogging into one handers. If they'll do it, then everybody else will start to demand anything. Swords into wands, wands into fist weapons and it will become clownfiesta, where cloth classes will look like fury warriors.
If there are no incentives to go out into the open world then it becomes a slippery slope toward all content becoming instanced.  Things like world buffs are the difference between the game being a true MMO; or a co-op dungeon crawler, arena brawler like retail.
It's never enough. It'll be 23 hours. And then, why can't it be 20, or 22 hours. And then why not 12 hours. Never enough.
Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it.
