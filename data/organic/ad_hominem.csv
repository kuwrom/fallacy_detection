Mr. Nixon misstates my figures constantly, which uh - is of course his right, but the fact of the matter is: here is where I stand and I just want to have it on the public record.
America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him.
We have seen him insult women.
Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well.
They were with the drug companies.
They're with the insurance companies.
He forgot to tell you he voted to tax Social Security benefits more than one time. I didn't hear any plan to fix Social Security.
And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA .  The gun lobby's on his side .  They're running millions of dollars of ads against me .
She doesn't have the stamina.
I notice particularly that he didn't endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform.
Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people. He's one of the wealthiest Americans, and he's our Vice President. In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes. In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes. That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work.
the most ruthless, fanatical... leaders that the world has ever seen
First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is.
Now in the last Congress - the special session of the Congress - there was a bill: one by the President, one by Senator Kennedy and members of his party. Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it - areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia - than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting. On the other hand we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken.
beautiful.But we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.
The president has never said whether or not he would do that. But we know from the people he's tried to appoint to the court he wants to.
The reason they keep trying to attack Halliburton is because they want to obscure their own record.
Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger .
Theyâ€™re murderers and some very bad people.And
If he keeps this up, he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.
strongly.I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth.
I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error.
It's a scaring -- he's trying to scare people in the voting booth.
The biggest complaint they haveâ€”it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama .
While he was CEO of Halliburton, they paid millions of dollars in fines for providing false information on their company, just like Enron and Ken Lay.
The big drug companies support Governor Bush's prescription drug proposal.
For those of you who he wants to scare into the voting booth to vote for him, hear me loud and clear.
Mr. Ford is - is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy.
As well, help is on the way, but it's certainly hard to tell it when he voted against the $87-billion supplemental to provide equipment for our troops, and then said he actually did vote for it before he voted against it.
And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, whoâ€™s her friend and not a good guy, by the way.
My opponent talks about fiscal sanity. His record in the United States Senate does not match his rhetoric.  He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times.
He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies.
So Congress passes the law, the President signs it, like he does a lot of things. But he, like welfare reform, I'm going to sign it but I'm going to try to change it next year.
He talks about a smaller government. There are actually more people in government except for people in defense related jobs. They're gone. The government's bigger than it was when President Kennedy was around, even though he says it's not.
We have a divided nation, because people like herâ€”and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart.
I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.
I think what is misleading is to say you can lead and succeed in Iraq if you keep changing your positions on this war. And he has.
Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.I don't buy that.
I strongly supported it. And members of Senator Dole's own party in the Senate killed it. And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill.
First of all, he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections.  In fact, he first didn't even want to do that.
Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment.
You know, this man has no credibility on the issue.
Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand there is a connected between the two.
But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall .
One, he clearly has a litmus test for his judges, which I disagree with.
when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment
But itâ€™s not only women, and itâ€™s not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African-Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.So
We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.So
As the politics change, his positions change.
Look, now sheâ€™s blamingâ€”she got caught in a total lie.
They oppose mine because they don't want to get Medicare involved because they're afraid that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for seniors who currently pay the highest prices of all.
She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change.We
Governor Carter apparently doesn't know the facts.
The president has denied 9. 2 million women $3,800 a year, but he doesn't hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire.
It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.
Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.Third
What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.
he lives in an alternative reality
Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.He
one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy
She doesn't have the look.
Secondly, Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children. And it wasn't me that let the polluters actually come into the halls of Congress, into the rooms, and rewrite the environmental laws. That's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me.
Mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation. And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18%.
I'm against quotas. This is, with all due respect, Governor, that's a red herring.
Weâ€™ve seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter.
a liar
Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthalâ€”heâ€™s another real winner that you haveâ€”and heâ€™s the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology.
you were totally out of control
I remember the vice president saying, Just give us a chance to get up there, we're going to make sure you get tax cuts. It didn't happen.
Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a healthcare bill in 1994, uh '93, but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill. And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the '94 elections so they could make that claim.
Senator Mondale made a very derogatory, very personal comment about General Brown uh - after the news story that uh - broke about General Brown.
I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.
I also have a much better temperament than she has
Sheâ€™s got tremendousâ€”sheâ€™s got tremendous hatred.
Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which he's trying to do tonight.
Again, well it's, you are very selective, Mr. President.
Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker-busting nuclear weapons. The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons. It doesn't make sense.  You talk about mixed messages. We're telling other people, You can't have nuclear weapons, but we're pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using.
It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America.
Hillary Clinton wanted the wall .
The problem we have is that, if you look at his record, he doesn't display the qualities of somebody who has conviction.
And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorist sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.And
You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that.
Stop scaring the seniors, Mr. President. You've already spent $45 million scaring seniors and tearing me apart. I think it's time to have a truce.
I believe it was her campaign that did it .
I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.
Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth.
theyâ€™re murderers, drug lords, drug problems
I'm wishy-washy
And Donald knows a lot about this .  He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower .  He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: You complain, I'll get you deported . 
Mine are words, and his was action. His was what heâ€™s done to women. Thereâ€™s never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation thatâ€™s been so abusive to women.
So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.
this racist lie
You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute.
Don't listen to him; he's a total loser.
It seems to me that you have a selective memory.
she's lying again
The president did nothing.
But the president made a mistake in invading Iraq.
his cavalier attitude
it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times
You can't trust what she says about nutrition because she's overweight.
he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.
I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill those values, how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country. If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don't pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country.
Now, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where you'll have to pay a fine if you don't provide health insurance that Senator Obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you.
You wrote a letter saying that you oppose taxpayer funding of abortion. Bill Clinton has the same type of a record.
an old washed-up terrorist
He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.I
And in the special session in which Senator Kennedy was calling the signals, along with Senator Johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the Congress already knew what it had before it.
When the vice president was CEO of Halliburton, they took advantage of every offshore loophole available.
And she lied. But sheâ€™s lied about a lot of things.I
she doesn't have the stamina.
storm.In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.
Weâ€™ve seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten.
And he will have a very difficult time dealing with somebody like President Yeltsin or Chancellor Kohl or Prime Minister Major or President Mitterrand, because truth and integrity are prerequisites to being president of the US.
Bill Clinton simply has trouble telling the truth?
Senator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion. He voted against that.  And then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present.  Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really -- one of the bad procedures, a terrible. And then, on the floor of the Illinois State Senate, he voted present.
the King of Debt
Your rhetoric, Senator, would be a lot more credible if there was a record to back it up. There isn't.
she's got no business ability
Ladies and gentlemen, that's just not true what he said. The Wall Street Journal said 96 percent of small businesses are not affected at all by my plan.  And you know why he gets that count? The president got $84 from a timber company that owns, and he's counted as a small business. Dick Cheney's counted as a small business. That's how they do things.
Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts.
And meanwhile, North Korea has got nuclear weapons. Talk about mixed messages. The president is the one that said, We can't allow countries to get nuclear weapons. They have.
many criminal illegal aliens
First of all, let me say he's not for a government-run health care system? I thought that's exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system.
Folks, they have no plan. They have absolutely no plan.
Now, as to why I should be and he shouldn't be, when he was a candidate in 1976, President Carter invented a thing he called the misery index. He added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation, and it came, at that time, to 12.5% under President Ford. He said that no man with that size misery index has a right to seek reelection to the Presidency. Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20%, and I think this must suggest something.
It's lies.
And she lied.
Typical politician. All talk, no action.
Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth. 3 words he fears most in the English language.
The vice president, I'm surprised to hear him talk about records.
The president just talked about Iraq as a center of the war on terror. Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it.
the whole racist birther lie
So it seems to me that we can talk about what we call Kenny, the great exaggerator. He just liked to make it sound exager, a little better, made him feel better.
This is relevant, because he was pushing for lifting sanctions when he was CEO of Halliburton.
Sheâ€™s got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States.
Mr. Nixon would add a guarantee to islands five miles off the coast of the re- Republic of China when he's never really protested the Communists seizing Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.
Well, why didnâ€™t she change it? Why didnâ€™t you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didnâ€™t is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do.
I don't believe she does have the stamina.
Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement. They should have been doing this for years.
This is the problem I have with the big spending liberals.
I'm a flip-flopper
Bill Clinton does not have the strength nor the character to be president of the US.
First of all, what my opponent wants you to forget is that he voted to authorize the use of force and now says it's the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place.
If you did that you could take away the incumbents' advantage because challengers like me would have a chance to run against incumbents like him for House races and Senate races
