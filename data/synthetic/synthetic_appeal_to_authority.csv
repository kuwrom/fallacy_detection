I remember one day on the floor I said now, gentlemen, let me tax your memories, and Kennedy jumped up and said, why haven't we thought of that before. You know, so one of your liberal friends.
Many, many very intelligent people think Bitcoin is a significant invention, yet this sub keeps denouncing it as a joke. And that stance has cost a lot of money over the years.  Ignore Bitcoin at your own peril.   Or why not just put 1-2% of your portfolio into it?
He has more experience than you or I and 99% of the special minded folks here. We're all armchair analysts here and I'd take a former elite MMA fighters opinion much more than I'd take any of our idiotic opinions.
or Pros and analysts have better knowledge than random redditors.  &amp;#x200B;  I dont agree with Doinb being a bottom tier mid at worlds, imo he is mid/low mid tier but these guys played vs him and other worldclass mids or are professional analysts who spend tons of hours studying these players.  &amp;#x200B;  Thats the problem with reddit in general
Are you listening to the CDC and the WHO? People who think they know more than the experts just confuse the shot out of me.
And we haveâ€”look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me. I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me. We talk about it all the time.
My fiancee is a doctor.  These pregnancies are not survivable. Get your facts right.
There is no bigger judgment for a president of the United states than how you take a nation to war. And you can't say, because Saddam might have done it 10 years from now, that's a reason; that's an excuse.
People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it'll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system.
And the reason President Eisenhower's vetoes have been sustained - the reason the Congress does not send up bills to him which they think will be vetoed - is because the people and the Congress, the majority of them, know the country is behind the President.
I'm more baffled by Reddit's reaction than by the call. It's a pen. It doesn't matter which team is playing better at the time, if you open your arms like that and the ball hits them, I'm sorry.  Brazilian retired ref Salvio Spinola said it was a clear penalty as well.
Random customer telling multi billion dollar company of 50 years how to run there own business.   Lol
Using your IQ as an argument to validate your point.   Just recently I saw an argument on Twitter and the one person was like I have an IQ of 130. That's in the top 2% of humanity. It's pretty clear who is right here.  Gosh. I hate those people.
Rule#1 when dealing with political issues: Anyone who believes that they know better than the experts in a given field are full of shit. This goes for commies, climate deniers, creationists, anti-vaxxers, etc. You can scream about appeal to authority fallacies all you want, it doesn't mean anybody should take you seriously.
Governor Rockefeller has been far more critical in June of our position in the world than I have been.
Who are you to judge their beer? Are you a certified beer judge? Do you have any beers you personally brewed to prove you know how to judge a beer?  Edit: lol you guys are amazing.
Shero and Hynes know more about player development and whats best for the team and players than we do. We trusted them in the past, we need to trust them now.
Who gives a shit? I feel like Q is like a worn out tire that needs to be recycled. I'm serious. When one of the largest conspiracy communities on the net rejects it, is it maybe possible it's horse shit? There is plenty of other places to discuss it.
Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down.  It hasn't worked.
The other day I was honored to be flanked by Colin Powell and General Norman Schwartzkopf recently stood by me side and agreed with me.
Well, all that I can suggest is that all the experts who have studied the program indicate that it is the most fantastic program, the worst program, insofar as its effect on the farmers, that the - America has ever had foisted upon it in an election year or any other time.
Read the post. I did show it to be true. Not in excruciating detail, but just by appealing to all of the towering intellects throughout history and up until the present that have accepted some religion as true.   And I am sure some atheists have engaged with the arguments Im talking about, but many of them have not. Just look at Stephen Fry and his Big Think interview. He thinks saying why is there so much evil in the world is a knockdown objection to the existence of God, when its only the beginning of a discussion that has been going on for thousands of years and can be traced back to Deuteronomy.
It's not 'made up'. this is a historian who bases his thesis on research.   from the radio broadcast: the historian bases his thesis on stories of Jesus from Eastern regions (Syria, Palestine etc), which are outside the Roman empire. These maintain that he was \_not\_ a son of God, but was a man of God. The Christian new testament, then, is the 'Western' story.   Have not read the book, so I cannot offer an opinion on his sources. But Fried is a bona fide academic historian. And having been a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study, he is certainly a well-regarded member of the academy.    From Wikipeida: Fried studied at the University of Heidelberg, where he obtained his doctorate in 1970 and his habilitation in 1977. He was professor at the University of Cologne 1980-1983 and holds the Chair of Mediaeval History at the University of Frankfurt am Main since 1983. He has been visiting Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton 1995-1996.
If you want somebody who is willing to fight for you, I am asking for your support and your vote and, yes, your confidence and your willingness to believe that we can do the right thing in America, and be the better for it.
You do realise Anthony Costello isn't just some writer, he was director of Global Health at UCL and had a position at the WHO. I know because I've filmed 30+ interviews for him (with lots of BAME scientists) - he knows his shit.
Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy.
I've a degree in psychology. I know what the actual textbook definition of narcissist is. You're the troll. Look at your fucking handle.
It's weird because prochoice people already have met their burden of proof because the supreme court has already weighed that an unborn human life is not a person. Since science cannot prove or disprove an evolving social construct, then the supreme court ruling is as high of validity as you can get with this
Reads like dis-info. Lot of research since to strongly suggest Shakespeare wasn't the real author. Nathaniel Hawthorne, Walt Whitman, and Mark Twain were Anti-Stratfordians, if that's the kind of evidence you're into. The only evidence that it was William Shakespeare is overshadowed by the evidence that he was just a pen name for others. Joe Atwill makes a case that it a woman. I like Bacon and de Vere. But it's a certainty that if you think it was William from Stratford then you haven't done any research on it at all.
But the Washington Post ran a long editorial today saying they couldn't believe Mr. Bush was making character an issue and they said he was the greatest quote political chameleon for changing his positions of all times.
the only gaslighting is coming from people who don't understand it's medical care, approved by doctors, and paid for by private insurance, so state insurance should cover it as well  if doctors and all the major medical organizations say it's clinical medicine that treats a medical problem, and you are here saying you know better then they do on a medical issue, you're the wrong one
This is an incredible video by someone who's part of the online sakuga community and has vast knowledge as well as connections to many industry members. Yet, guess what?   82% upvoted. To the percent that's downvoting, why? Everything he said here is 100% correct.
The word fascism has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies something not desirable                 George Orwells
This sounds ridiculous for to me because I understand bitcoin and the fundamentals behind it but my dad (who doesnt know anything about CS) swears that its valid. I have a CS degree so this question sounds ridiculous for me to ask.
He's talking about his plan to keep jobs here. You know he calls it an outsourcing to keep -- stop outsourcing.
I suggest you google it and see that it is a real app created by stanford graduates and they are real people not anonymous scammers.
That was in an ad, Jim, that was knocked down by the journalists who analyzed the ad and said it was misleading.
Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if you're going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you'd better be prepared to pull the trigger.
I'm literally a Child and Adolescent psychiatrist. This is one of the areas in which I specialize, and I follow the latest research and AACAP guidelines. I'd love to know, where'd they get their medical license?
1. I'm a DM. 2. He specifically told me he put it on here to Taunt me. 3. I've already mentioned the thing with him vetoing any possible wish. 4. My character atleast has the right to try.
I'm not a politician, but I think I could go to Washington in a week and get everybody holding hands and get this bill signed because I talk to the Democratic leaders and they want it. I talk to the Republican leaders and they want it.
Have you ever considered that maybe, just *maybe*, actual historians and people who have spent their lives studying events like this might have a better and more nuanced understanding of it and the terms needed to describe it than an ignorant vitriol-spewing keyboard warrior like you?
I especially love it when this subreddit tries to talk down to Cruz, as if they somehow know more about MMA than he does.
Is this the same Denise Minger who wrote a takedown article of The China Study, and basically Campbell's entire life's work, yet her highest level of education is a bachelor's in English? The same Denise Minger without a shred of credentials or experience as a scientist/doctor in the fields of nutrition, anthropology, epidemiology or the human body?  If so then I'll take a hard pass on her opinions regarding nutrition...
I don't think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power.
As the President said the other night, there will always be troubles in this ol' world, but the United States of America can be counted on to provide the vision that the world looks for from the United States of America.
I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods, and that's why I'm a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat, the Boston Police Department the other day.
Only the views of scientists should be listened to otherwise it's not science.
I believe that Ronald Reagan, John Kennedy, and the others did that more effectively, and I'm going to try to follow in their footsteps.
Well, some brief research tells me that he's not taken very seriously in the scientific community. So if you don't mind me asking, why do you take his work seriously?   For me, I distrust him because of my lack of expertise. I believe that because I am not an expert, it's only fair that I yield my opinions to whatever the consensus amongst experts might be. This will, of course, result in me being wrong at times, but I believe it to be the scientific way of thinking and if I'm paying thousands of dollars to be a scientist I might as well think like one lol.
So the next time one of your friends nitpicks a film you love to death, say if suspending disbelief was good enough for Aristotle - one of the greatest minds this world has ever known - why cant YOU BELIEVE [fill in the argument youre having with your friend].
You mean like that piker, Brian Kernigahn?  What would HE know?  Whippersnapper...
It's not the government's money, it's your money. You're entitled to it, and we would like to see to it that we provide tax relief for everybody who pays taxes.
There are Republican leaders, like John McCain, like Richard Lugar, like Chuck Hagel, who have said Iraq is a mess and it's getting worse.
Really good question - as the person in the OP I'd love to clarify, speaking from my own field (critical rhetoric, academic debating, cognitive theory , ethics) feminism has transformed how theory-making is done. This is true in the hard sciences too, per the many many academic friends I have. For context, I've coached national championship winning debate programs, 5 national championship finalist debaters, and taught in higher education (public university systems) across 5 states and 15 years.      The long and the short of it is, if you are operating in an intellectual space and not engaging feminist critical perspectives then you are doing stone-aged theory and can't get too upset if you're ignored.
So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have.
Except the accusation is from the DFEH, not complete nobodies.
You aren't an epidemiologist, we can be pretty sure of that - so your speculations can and should be ignored.
Secretary Bill Cohen, a good republican, and Gen. Shelton the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will both tell you the American military is ready to meet any threat we may face in the world today.
But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers' salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee.
My biology textbook (tenth grade) says that races for humans don't exist anymore, and I honestly don't think schools would teach blatantly wrong information just to appease to the current political or cultural climate. Science is still science.
Specifically, look at George Tenet, the CIA director's testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations two years ago when he talked about a 10-year relationship.
I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas and 9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans said, this is the way you've got to go.
If we can just tap the intelligence and ability, the sound common sense and the good judgment of the American people, we can once again have a foreign policy to make us proud instead of ashamed.
A general rule of thumb is to decide based on what the church has historically regarded as literal, allegorical, or both. It is only a very recent development that people have been interpreting everything literally.
But at the same time Michael Morse is a former professional ballplayer.  His word holds weight due to experience. What would he gain from lying here?
But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obama's set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region.
Im still really aggravated by Elon Musks stupidity in tweeting about the panic of the virus being dumb, people are going to have read that and completely thrown care to the wind regarding the virus because he is viewed so highly. Is it still dumb with the incredibly speedy rise of infections in the US and Europe Elon? Or was that the fear of losing profit or having to close down production speaking before your brain.
And the vice president didn't say much about it in your earlier question, but Paul Bremer has now made clear that they didn't have enough troops and they didn't have a plan.
Mr. Stone, I have submitted an economic plan that I have worked out in concert with a number of fine economists in this country, all of whom approve it, and believe that over a five year projection, this plan can permit the extra spending for needed refurbishing of our defensive posture, that it can provide for a balanced budget by 1983 if not earlier, and that we can afford - along with the cuts that I have proposed in Government. spending
From a practicing judge?
They saw a man who was strong, who had conviction, who is resolute, who made it very clear that he will do everything that has to be done to find terrorists, to keep the American people safe.
I remember a lady in Houston, Texas, told me, Reading is the new civil right, and she's right.
Yeah let's take your word for it.. a Reddit warrior with no actual competitive experience against pros.. lmao
country.I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we justâ€”just came in.
It's not Anarcho-Primitivist, Dr. Peterson said it was fascist. Do you have a degree in clinical psychology and teach at UofT? Didn't think so.
I would imagine, from the decades of study and peer reviewed literature he has published over the years earning him the title of Dr and subsequently Professor. Kinda trumps high school and Wikipedia.
Is it really? Are you a historian?
Tonight in the audience there's one elected state senator who is a Democrat, a former state-wide officer who is a Democrat, a lot of Democrats who are here in the debate to -- because they want to show their support that shows I know how to lead.
And Colin Powell so stated.
Mr. George Allen, head of your Information Service, has said that that made the people of the world begin to wonder whether we were first in science. We're first in other areas of science but in space, which is the new science, we're not first.
He's just not credible when he talks about being fiscally conservative. He's just not credible. If you look at his record in the Senate, he voted to break the caps -- the spending caps -- over 200 times. And here he says he's going to be a fiscal conservative, all of a sudden. It's just not credible. You cannot believe it.  And of course he's going to raise your taxes.
Are you a Harvard scientist?
Unless the president speaks, then of course uh - the country doesn't speak, and Franklin Roosevelt said: The pre - uh - the presidency of the United States is above all a place of moral leadership.
As a child and adolescent psychiatrist, I'm like, come at me, bro. I haz research.. They're still assholes but they can't claim to be more of an expert in the field than I am!
\&gt; People complaining about Rest dont understand Principles of game design   i'm a game designer and i hate rest. i'm valid
Id tend to believe the people with relevant degrees.
yeah, don't listen to me. I'm not a professional or anything - it's not like animal welfare &amp; veterinary medicine make up the majority of my career, professional knowledge, and skill set! I definitely have no idea what I'm talking about, but you sure do. you're so smart and brave.
Always funny to see all these comments about coaches with bad play calling game after game. Why aren't the NFL teams looking at reddit game threads? So much untapped talent out here!
But I believe that all of us together, and I believe the Presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was. It's a bully pulpit.
And that is why, in this field, I have made recommendations which I am confident will move the American economy ahead - move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the Soviet Union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field.
Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn't believe in a timetable.
That your opinion is every bit as valid as that of trained experts. The rot of subjective reality began to take root in colleges in the 1960s, but the internet took it pro.
All of these things and all the promises and commitments that Senator Obama and I made (inaudible) made to you tonight will base -- will be based on whether you can trust us or not to be careful stewards of your tax dollar, to make sure America is safe and secure and prosperous, to make sure we reform the institutions of government.
&gt;Jason Stanley, a Yale philosophy professor who wrote How Fascism Works  Sounds like a really smart guy, I bet he did vote for Clinton.  &gt;Cas Mudde, a political scientist at the University of Georgia who's an expert on populism, extremism, and democracy.  Huh another obviously very intelligent expert, if what you're saying is correct then all the smart people voted for Clinton.   &gt;Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a historian at New York University who's an expert on authoritarianism  What, another historian who's an expert on authoritarianism. So many smart people.   Imagine being terrified of experts and scientists, professors, doctors etc like Trump supporters are.
As a matter of fact, one of the secretaries of HEW under Mr. Carter testified that he thought there was $7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it. We've had the Central Accounting. Office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone, and they have added that waste adds even more to that.
If Chris Bledsoe isn't credible then why are these names interested in visiting him and his family? These are not nobodies....  * Jim Semivan (CIA) * Mike Morrell (CIA) * Hal Povenmire (NASA)
How about you let the scientists worry about it.
Admiral Mullen suggests that Senator Obama's plan is dangerous for America.
Welp, tweets are not peer-reviewed.  This third-hand commentary is coming from a guy who graduated [The Johns Hopkins University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Johns_Hopkins_University), with Honors in Public Health. He also has a dual doctorate in epidemiology, and doctorate in nutrition, with a doctoral minor in biostatistics, from [Harvard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard). He also completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the [Harvard School of Public Health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_School_of_Public_Health).  He also ran for Congress as Democratic candidate representing his native [Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania%27s_10th_congressional_district)...maybe his style leans more sensationalist due to his personality/desire for popularity.  (source: wiki)
But I think it makes sense, I think most Americans in their guts know, that we ought to pass a sort of truth standard.
And it's now the smallest number that we have had since the -- the smallest in size since John Kennedy's administration.
I've talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington.
What do you think of Nazi historian Christopher R Browning pointing out the troubling similarities?  We're not saying he is literally hitler, just that he is acting very similar to the early stages of Nazi Germany.
I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.
And I was able to do so with a lot of Democrat votes, nearly 50% of the Hispanic vote, about 27% of the African-American vote, because people know I'm a conservative person and a compassionate person.
uneducated, personal opinion lmao Adam and his team do lots of research for every episode of Adam Ruins Everything, and in addition to that Adam Conover has a college degree in Philosophy. Maybe if you wanted the absolute best degree for policy-making, something like History or Economics could be better, but Philosophy is a solid field and much more accurate for critiquing society than any STEM degree which I assume these commenters have, for the few that even have a college degree. I mean don't get me wrong, STEM degrees are great, but not very relevant in this case. Adam probably prefaces a lot of stuff with Im not an expert but he's definitely a lot closer to one than most Joe Rogan listeners (or guests, for that matter). There's probably something to be said about the Dunning-Kruger effect here.
Everyone I have spoken to, be they hunters, farmers et cetera, have said you do not need MSSAs \[military-style semiautomatic weapons\] or an assault weapon to go hunting or do farm business. These are guns designed to kill people.  &#x200B;  This part stuck out to me. The Police Minister said this. It makes it seem like he took the opinions of farmers and hunters to force laws onto other people.   &#x200B;  Imagine if the government said we've spoken to various soccer moms and people who use vehicles to drive to and from work... they've said that you don't need vehicles with V6, V8, or V12 engines so anyone who does... turn them in.  &#x200B;  Maybe a terrible example, due to me being an idiot... but just weird to take the opinion of a few and force them onto many.
There is now a federal judge's opinion about the current management of this program ordering the State of Texas to do -- you should read that judge's language about this.
Ask the people in the armed forces today.
Teams in F1, F2, FE, Indy and WRC seem to think hes alright enough to hire him. But what do they know
I'm not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan. So I'm not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan.
I'm sure you could do a much better job. This is why you are the lead designer in a game as successful as FFXIV.  Right?
Well, after reading all of the responses below, I would say that Dr. Berg is more credible than those who replied.  Dr. Berg has a a respected/reputable dietary intervention practice.  What do you think the folks who responded have? A cell phone?
So, you dismiss the analysis of any number of pro players and community analysts as biased judgement resulting from a resistance to change rather than acknowledging the validity of their own positions, *and then* ask to be heard out yourself.   Not exactly the best rhetorical strategy for getting a point across.
&gt; To be fair it isn't China that's crippling America  You're right, its the trump administration that crippled america by A) disbanding our pandemic task force, and B) ignoring the information they had on the pandemic in **november**.  &gt; when far less extreme measures most likely would suffice.  So you know better than every medical expert that has talked openly about this topic?
Reading a CIA experiment can't be seen has a waste of time. It's literally the intelligence agency. If they are looking at it and have been for a very long time. There has to be something to it. I've read almost every document, really informative stuff.
I've never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office. I have a direct relationship with hundreds of people around - hundreds of thousands around the country who actively campaign for me.
Well, if the co-discoverer of DNA Francis Crick believes our genetic code shows evidence of directed panspermia, I think I'll give his view more weight than pretty much anyone on Reddit.
Dave Meltzer has been reviewing professional wrestling matches longer than many of the people here have been ALIVE.  Its not that people take his review and star ratings as concrete but rather they respect his opinion and his vast experience reviewing and watching pro wrestling matches and believe his rankings   (The man has probably watched more wrestling matches than just about anyone right now)  And if that doesnt do it for you, then dont pay attention to them, but there are plenty of good reasons to take stock in the Meltzer star reviews. The man has been doing it as long as anyone.  If you cant put stock in Meltzer's reviews; then fuck.. Who's reviews can you put stock into?
And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender.
Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it? He said, I'll get back to you. And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.
Good ol' race baiting. Gotta love how the alt-right pushes this narrative. A number of prominent medical officials have noted China 'bought the world time' with its extreme containment measures. Well, except America. The US sat on its ass not testing people and not providing guidance to hospitals on the infrastructure improvements they need. Major hospitals in China have hundreds of ventilators because of past epidemics. American hospitals, well, you're lucky if your local hospital has 5.
And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as.
What I think troubles a lot of people in our country is that the president has just sort of described one kind of mistake.
And it permits - economists on the East Coast and West think it's good - it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes.
You know how non-theists get super frustrated with the woeful ignorance of Christians when they ignore simple science because it doesnt match their faith?  Well that fits in the same category as the Jesus Mythicist arguments.   Justify it all you want. Try to bring your scientific methods into it fine. But you are simply ignorant of actual, academic historical methods used to determine the historicity of basic figures and events throughout time. The vast majority of secular historians agree on this. Only the most devout and biased anti-theists make this claim. It was popular in the Soviet era and runs through similar circles now.   Lay aside any faith based interpretations on the life of Jesus. They arent needed to make the very simple historical conclusion that a man existed.  Go ahead and vote me down now.
I had a discussion with my daughter, Amy, the other day, before I came here, to ask her what the most important issue was. She said she thought nuclear weaponry - and the control of nuclear arms. This is a formidable force.
Im sure young people couldnt tell you how vaccines work either but would be up in arms if someone tried to ban them. Usually its a better idea to listen to the experts rather than try to become one yourself, because youre more likely to make mistakes.
Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high.
We ask the people that are viewing tonight, are you better off than you were four years ago.
Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to.
Is, as Mr. Nixon says, our prestige at an all-time high, as he said a week ago, and that of the Communists at an all-time low? I don't believe it is. I don't believe that our relative strength is increasing.
That's the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think it's a important judgment.
we believe there are way too many abortions in this country. And the way to reduce them is by reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies, not vetoing family planning legislation the way George Bush has consistently done.
The Nobel prize-winning scientist who discovered HIV looked at covid and asserts it is a bioengineered virus, so what's the problem with a dedicated cypherpunk expressing the same?  Besides, if you truly follow crypto, you would already be worried about China. You would be naturally be opposed to anything that is the opposite of crypto, which would include CCP and its abusive, centralized, untransparent nature...
My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here. She had one of the greatest lines of all lines. She said, reading is the new civil right. She's right.
I was just endorsed by ICE.
I was made aware by another user that most scientists agree that life begins at conception: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3211703  I'll be editing my original post shortly.
Person here who has done a degree in psychology, from my personal perspective; IQ does not measure intelligence it simply gives us an insight into ones ability to take a test and memorise sequences etc. Theres massive flaws in the IQ test thats highlighted by language and cultural barriers.
At least the author is up front about being ill informed on the subject and not knowing of any negative utilitarians. Not that it justifies the logical fallacies all over this essay. I mean he even starts off using an appeal to popularity/authority as a reason not to bother doing the necessary research to find one.   Negative Utilitarianism (NU) is treated as a non-starter in mainstream philosophical circles, and to the best of my knowledge has never been supported by any mainstream philosopher, living or dead.
My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights.
Tell that to Oxford economist Martin Wolf. If only he had seen your insightful analysis before he published his own research...

It's a strategy that will succeed. And Pakistan is a very important element in this. And I know how to work with them. And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that I'm going to attack them.
And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow.
If you look back over the last eight years, the most significant accomplishments of this administration in which Al Gore was centrally involved were the result, most of them, of bipartisan agreements.
Well, first of all, there are virtually no large differences in the defense budgets put forward by President Clinton and put forward by the majority in the Congress in the last two years.
Last point about Senator McCain's plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Senator McCain's plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage.
Just so you know Im not going to read that because 1.) Im on the debate and political history team 2.) thats too much.
how is it a scam if you use it as your source of vitamin c on days when you do not otherwise reach your suggested intake, or if someones diet lacks enough vitamin c in general?  they literally advertise it as immune support, not that it boosts your immune system.  let me guess, you have no background in any of this stuff, and you learned this was a scam from reddit comments?
so.I ask Hillary, why doesnâ€™tâ€”she made $250 million by being in office. She used the power of her office to make a lot of money. Why isnâ€™t she funding, not for $100 million, but why donâ€™t you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?
And the formula I've given you works, we've put it through a good economic model, we've got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who's a very respected economist in the - Massachusetts. And they agree, that if we can do what I've said, we can get it down without going and socking the American taxpayer once again.

You shouldn't. All my decks are 100 - 107 card decks. Mostly just Vampire tribal. My current 107 card deck has taken me to platinum and I usually only play till my daily quests are done.
My biggest concern is that you are defining what fair is.  Can the pot tell the person who made it that it is unfair how he made him, or what he defines as fair?   If God deems this fair and righteous, how can we challenge God's sovereignty?
What happens in South Africa, where, for example, the Nobel Prize winner, 2 days ago, said this administration is seen as working with the oppressive government of South Africa.
Any science heads want to validate this study?
Clearly a whole studio of incredibly successful graphics designers thought they were good, but a few guys on Reddit knows better what good design is, right?
Sorry to break it to her. The CDC, The National Cancer Institute, and The American Cancer Society say otherwise. Maybe she should have read the article.
Am guessing Australia and Canada still haven't discovered meth.   One of my favorite quotes is from a psych doctor who told me,    You can have functioning alcoholics, weed heads, cocaine heads and even people who use heroine. But have you ever seen or heard of a functioning meth head.?
With all due respect, I do not believe that Abraham Lincoln would have adopted Bob Dole's position to end all affirmative action.
I think uh - the uh - increase and the uh - prospects as far as I'm concerned and the I - less favorable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter uh - is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes. He tends to distort on a number of occasions.
The CBO said very clearly that if you were to adopt the president's plan, there would be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security, because today's workers pay in to the system for today's retirees. And the CBO said -- that's the Congressional Budget Office; it's bipartisan -- they said that there would have to be a cut in benefits of 25 percent to 40 percent.
Senator Obama voted against Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts on the grounds that they didn't meet his ideological standards. That's not the way we should judge these nominees.

The Kaaba has a similar function to idols in that it serves as material object used for worshipping a deity, the main difference being that idols represent the deity while Kaaba does not.  Furthermore it is helpful to keep in mind that Abraham as far as historians is concerned didnt exist as an actual historical figure, so to claim the Kaaba was built by him carries with it two unsubstantiated claims.
Bernie Sanders is nothing more than a candidate going for president. Maybe I'll vote he seems good.. idk. -- Dr. Mos (has PhD degree)
They are the second largest scientific journal in their field. Who are you?
I believe I'm going to win, because the American people know I know how to lead.
But I know this, that President Kennedy in his inaugural address told all of us that here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own.
Ya! Let us (who know little to nothing about the inner workings of congress) call the shots in congress! Not a lifelong politician who actually has any fucking clue what shes doing!!!  /s  Stop letting your fear cause you to blame the only people fighting tyranny FOR you, while you sit comfortably at home....  When youre fighting this too (in the streets or politically) THEN youll have any room at all to talk. Until then, sit down and stop being a parent coaching from the sideline. Its embarrassing
I also saw the excerpt that youre citing as the main thesis.  Although the author didnt really dive into how an idea is decided to be meritorious or not, Id imagine his ideal model would be similar to the process of peer review for publication in an academic journal.  A council of respected experts in a field can certainly weed out the poorly crafted ideas.  If someone cant get their work published in a journal (or has but such work has later been debunked), then why should they be given a speaking platform at a college or university?
Well, two leading national news networks have both said the president's characterization of my health-care plan is incorrect. One called it fiction. The other called it untrue.
But I pledge this to you, America: I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure.
This, or that everyones opinions are equally valid. No, the guy who has a PhD and 10years of experience in the fields opinion is more valid than your 10min google search.
have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief.
It baffles me that the NRA just let people getting killed while doctors have no say about preventing more tragedies
I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.
I'm proud that important military figures who are supporting me in this race: former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday, General Eisenhower's son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; General Admiral William Crown; General Tony McBeak, who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father -- all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief.
And if you support them, don't be surprised that that is exactly what they want to do and that is why Dan Quayle refuses to say this evening that he supports the right of a woman to choose.
I cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the -- the policies and the laws to their advantage.
I kind of wish they'd stop putting any resources into the bridge at all, honestly.  Desktop email clients are such a '90s tech, anyway.  I say that as a paid Visionary user who is a 20 year IT veteran with experience in multiple messaging platforms.
How do you answer the question that CAA was actually advanced by Gandhi and Manmohan Singh as PM?
Speaking of the right to health care, in 1961 Ronald Reagan, I'm paraphrasing here, basically sayed this (this is not the exact quote):  Socialized medicine leads to socialism  So, yeah, let's not have that, also in a Canadian Supreme Court case, Chaoulli v Quebec, the court ruled that, the Quebec Health Insurance Act and also the Hosptial Insurance Act, that prohibit private medical insurance due to the long waiting times, is violated the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms and Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Sadly the decision only applied to Quebec, but even still, this means it's immoral.
And everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal, hardly a friend of the Democratic party of this administration, that the '82 tax increase he sponsored in inflation-adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history.
I'm also curious as to who badged it and why.  My intent on posting it was to give voice to an articulate and educated man who is asking us to take a wider view of things that we don't understand. There are a few replies here that think he is nothing more than an nutjob standing on a street corner with a sign that reads, The end is nigh!
And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy.
I've been feeling this way about China bad for quite a while, but what the fuck do I know, I've only been to China and Hong Kong a million times and have a degree in this shit. I guess I should defer to some dude who got upvoted 16k for reposting a CNN article.
 While we appreciate the concern, you didn't do anything wrong  THANK you, Valve, for saying this. Dear God, all the traders who insisted that people who just opened crates were somehow breaking the rules were absolutely insufferable.
Well, I hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us, listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be president of the United States listen to the Vice President very carefully.
 The day you achieve everything that Elon has accomplished, that day you speak, you are just another engineer.  Anyone who uses this argument is a fucking tool.
And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button .
Global warming set the stage for the new leftists strategy. It's settled science. The debate is over. It's consensus among the experts. We must do as they say or you're evil.
They did a study on this. They asked experts which questions they thought were the most culturally biased, and then they looked at how each race scored on each question, and they found blacks actually do the worst on the questions that were rated less culturally biased.  Also if its about being from a first world nation can you explain to me why Belarusians, Macedonians &amp; Bosnians have IQs over 1 standard deviation higher then rich Arab countries like Kuwait &amp; Qatar?
I broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and Ronald Reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for.
But whether I agree or disagree with some individual, or what he may say, or how he may say it, I don't think there's any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which we've abandoned so much in this country.
It's not what the American people thought they were getting when they voted.
Guys, I hate to say it but I'm pretty sure these NHL linesmen understand the offside rules better than us. As others have said, both players were technically tagged up before MacAvoy touched it. Move on.
An Air Force General not too long ago in Europe who said that pretty soon we'd have airplanes without engines, tank commanders who can't drive their tanks more than three-quarters of a mile, because they don't have enough fuel. Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling.
Are you saying that the people on r/badhistory and r/AskHistorians are wrong? Do you think you know more about the history of religion than them?
Why is what this sub thinks more important than the man who gets paid by a billionaire to make trades?
For the newer players who aren't aware: this is a former World Champion saying this, his words have weight.
And a recent book that just came out by perhaps the Nation's most respected author in this field, Strobe Talbott, called Deadly Gambits,'' concludes that this President has failed to master the essential details needed to command and lead us, both in terms of security and terms of arms control.
Im not saying youre wrong but David Sinclair takes D with K. Am I to trust him or a random redditor?
We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, veryâ€”I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.We
I said, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed with me, that it was time for us to turn our research ability to seeing if we could not find this kind of defensive weapon. And suddenly somebody says, Oh, it's got to be up there, and it's Star Wars,'' and so forth.
That is is made-made, that it is bioterrorism, that it will kill everyone I can go on and on.  Lots of misinformation out there! - Dr. Carlos del Rio
Did anything in my post say I agreed with the thread? No, it didnt, so I have nothing to reconsider.  Did people say they were offended or something was offensive? Yes, they did. To that, see Stephen Fry quote. Do you disagree with Stephen Fry?
I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.
I find it funny how often the GOP, the self proclaimed champion of business, dismisses the opinions of Warren Buffet...a man who is the actual, no shit businessman that Donald Trump has always pretended to be.
People can say fans are overreacting all they want. But a two time super bowl winning, pro bowl left guard, ex patriot.. agrees that Gronk is washed up
On a real note, I hate people who won't listen to others because of their credentials, education, etc. It's such an awful personality trait. 10/10 meme thank u
This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election .
It's very odd how average people sitting behind a computer screen in their dorm or rented room, are infantilizing/criticizing two men who have achieved more out of life than most people could possibly hope or imagine.   They're holding the top office in two of the most prominent countries in the world and have gotten their on their hard work (even rallying takes a lot of work and work ethic and unspeakable effort, early mornings, sleepless nights, constant travel), they have connected with hundreds of thousands of people, and will leave a legacy. They have families and have provided for themselves and their loved ones to last generations. They have donated more than an average person makes in years, and changed people's lives for the better through a multitude of ways.  Love them or hate them, the criticism is always odd. It makes me want to ask 'What have you done today?' At least you can do your laundry list, I guess.
Nope. Olan is a professional. He knows what he is doing.
I think the American people want it now. Every place I go I talk about it, and I think they want it done.
Paul Tsongas, a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was to oppose the capital gains cut.
And in my state I'm proud to say we've organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country.
The American people can make up their mind about whether that's a liberal record or a record that's good for America. Liberal, conservative, you put whatever label you want on it.
LOL the editors all agreed it was good enough for publication in The Lancet. I'm going to side with their expertise rather than a angry redditor screed nearly 100% of the time when it comes to medical knowledge. Part of medical knowledge is understanding the cost of care and impact on their patients.
You think we would belive that some redditor refuted Nobel prize winning economist :)
But I don't know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack.
but who is more likely to figure out the right choice: the head of a government infectious diseases institution who dedicated his life to academic research of pandemics, or the average monkey-brained individual (me included)? especially in situations like a pandemic where the choices of a few can affect the whole.
Admirals Spruance and Callins in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands, in their conference in the Far East.
They know the Republican Party hasn't done it. They know the Democratic party won't do it. We ought to agree that somebody else should do it. And we have to vote it up or down, Mr. President.
Now you judge for yourselves whether or not that's fair.
And you folks out there are going to have to choose who you think is right.
it.In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE.
I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980.
The American people now are facing, next Tuesday, a lonely decision. Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country.
He's not. But he knows Better Than The Experts (tm).
Im glad kyle called him out on his BS recently.. he acts like he knows better than every president &amp; joint chiefs of the past 40 years
But McVay has been in the NFL for years and years. Who are we to criticize? None of us have coached or played at an elite level before. Us criticizing a football coach for his decisions is like the casual reader challenging a scientist for his discoveries. Who are we to judge on a subject that we are not qualified for? Shouldn't we trust his judgement of a coach who is much more knowledgable and experienced in his field?
Senator Obama doesn't want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to -- with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping FARC, the terrorist organization.
You must always remember that a president can't stop anything unless he has the people behind him.
Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek were both okay with wealth redistribution. You can redistribute wealth without restricting free markets.
And I -- and I honestly don't believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian invasion -- aggression in Georgia
Show them Einstein's piece called why socialism, and ask them why the smartest human to live in recent history was an ardent socialist.
But at least some Christians don't make their own decisions in this case.    They cite the work of previous religious people to justify the canon you have. If you were building your canon from scratch based on your own logic at least liberal Christians would have serious issues justifying keeping books widely believed to be forgeries today.  Dale Allison certainly believes that there are forgeries and interpolations. Yet he cannot just remove them. So he IS looking to older Christians and the traditions they made.
Yes, the psychologists and doctors far smarter than you agree that it would be child abuse to force a child into a gender role that is not their own. That's why they gave their approval to this and recommend it. Good catch!
In fact, what, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, we'll give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it.
Now as far as President Eisenhower is concerned, I have often heard him discuss this question. As I uh - related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun.
You hear this Fed Chairs? This 18 year old said you're all incompetent. Better turn in your doctorate degrees and hand the reigns over to reddit
Love all the people here who obviously know better than all the guys who spend their full time jobs working on who to draft.   No body knows this is a stupid draft pick until at least the end of next season.  This has to be one of the most whiny ass fan bases in all of sports.
Let me just tell you who the jury is. The people of Texas.
General Ridgway has said the same thing.
I think Season 8 was far better than people give it credit. But it was still a train wreck in the final assessment, in my opinion.   Thanks for demonstrating the same dismissive behaviors the essay and Dr Haidt are describing.
Analysts from all over the world are supporting this theory. Sounds like youre the one with their head up their own ass.
Ultimately, upset fans will eventually have to come to terms with the fact that this is Star Trek, and the very heroes they look up to are telling them that. And they need to look long and hard about what Star Trek is and is about and if they as fans have been true to that.
There is no good reason to take stories/accounts of miracles seriously  I propose that for a modern account of a miracle, if the person telling you the account is trustworthy, that is a reason to take the account seriously.
I thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman. I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely.
Haidt is a highly respected psychologist and has written some great books.  Anything he has to say is worth listening to.  Your comment is unfounded.
I mean Sir Roger Penrose is one of the leading physicists in the world. Did you even watch the video?
The descendants of Jewish people who were actually in concentration camps in Germany (as well as a few living survivors) agree that the detention centers at the border are concentration camps.
This is one doctor vs. almost everyone else in their field though. I want to get out of my house just as much as the next person but we can't cherry pick information and articles and run around telling everyone how wrong they are. (Although that's most of reddit).
His running mate Jack Kemp once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didn't hike.
Well every infectious disease specialist says otherwise but sure some rando on the internet who's not an infectious disease doctor has it figured out. \*jerkoff motion*
Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing. I agree with him. I mean, we agree with that.
to sign immigration reform, and George W .  Bush supported it, as well .
Do you think you know more than 2 Stanford doctors?
And one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt.
And incidentally, Mel Carnahan in Missouri had the finest record on diversity in any governor in the entire history of the State of Missouri. And I want to honor that among his other achievements here.
Now, remember, folks, even Senator Dole's campaign co-chair here, Senator D'Amato, says he's got to cut Medicare to pay for this.
And when people vote, I think you're going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that I'm talking about.
I have a JD, an MBA, and an MSF so I am pretty well versed in the skill sets. What about a JD would make you think you could do finance?  It is a pretty in depth math program. There are some advanced math skills needed that are covered nowhere in undergrad or a JD unless you were also a finance major for BS.   This is law school arrogance at its finest. Why not a brain surgeon?
And I need the help of everybody across this country to get it passed in a substantial way by the Congress.
This risky $550-billion tax scheme that I talked about earlier is said by the Concord Coalition, including Republicans like Pete Peterson and Warren Rudman, to pose a threat to our nation's ability to have a sensible defense budget in the future.
I think those are very very serious questions of judgment, which those of you who are watching us here tonight have a right to judge and review.
Don't get the price hike is bearish argument. Why would they be raising prices if growth was sluggish? Also, if the goal were to pad weak earnings why would they need to preannounce? Why not just announce the price hike on the call? I think the two things are completely independent. I seriously doubt Reed Hastings went over their numbers for the quarter and said OH SHIT! QUICK- RAISE THE PRICES SO WE DON'T HAVE A QUARTERLY SELLOFF!!!! That's just not how these companies operate, quarter to quarter. If they are raising prices it's because they have data that shows customers don't care and it's good for their long-term prospects. It's just like the people arguing they were dumb to pay $100 million to renew friends. The people leading this company are not morons. They are data-driven and if they made these decisions it's because they have good reason to.
Seems extremely unlikely that there would be such an immediate change.  You have a medical degree or just using your feelz?
Because has won the support of a great many people all over the state and I think it's a model for what I hope we can do across the country.
Pex is used almost exclusively on This Old House builds.  I can't imagine that Rich Trethuey, a veteran plumber and host, or the producers of  TOH, or PBS who airs it would be comfortable advocating for unproven technology.  Copper is old technology, expensive materials, and expensive install.  What's not to love about PEX?
He is one of, if not the most, famous victims of these abuses AND in the know about all of the intricate details.  If he still thinks it needs to stay, after everything he's been through with Russia-gate maybe we should listen...   Many protections exist, most importantly the FISA court, to ensure that US Citizens are not illegitimately unmasked in this process.  Those protections,  we now know, were purposely ignored and information was withheld on purpose which led to Trump having his wires tapped. As he has consistently said he wants to and is working towards ensuring this never happens to another President.
I read a report, or a memo, from somebody in his 1988 campaign -- I forgot the fellow's name -- warning then Senator Gore to be careful about exaggerating claims. I thought during his debate with Senator Bradley saying he authored the EITC when it didn't happen.
Everybody -- every economist, every businessman -- believes that. Your own Council of Economic Advisers -- Mr. Feldstein in his report told you that. Every chairman of the Finance and Ways and Means Committee, Republican leaders in the Senate and the House are telling you that. That deficit is ruining the long-term hopes for this economy.
I know the governor's not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, I'm told, except for three where they notified, and they're trying to break out of the box, there's no question about it.
And the budget plan that I've put out, according to the Los Angeles Times again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years.
There are prominent MLB players who say exactly that.. so not sure what makes you the expert over them  Edit: provided article in another comment for context
What if the group youre part of is relevant? Is that annoying too? Im guilty of doing this when the situation arises but I do it when I actually am part of the group that is being discussed.
I think he said that Israel was a - a military burden on us and that Iran hoped to reestablish the Persian Empire. Ah - I'm not uh - sure that I remembered earlier that President Ford had - had expressed uh - his concern about the statement or apologized for it.
theyre much funnier and have actually played at the highest level, so they know what theyre talking about, at least for the mental aspect of the game. plus, ive never felt they dont believe what theyre saying, like i do w skip or stephen a
Well, to say that this is the best economy in 30 years just staggers the imagination. We have a growth rate of the last four years of about two and a half percent. My friend Al Gore says it  's better than the Reagan years. It isn't.
In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny
Go back to the time he was, what, Texas director for George McGovern. George McGovern is a friend of mine, so I don't mean, but he was a liberal, proud liberal.
We need a new subreddit.          The Prequels started bad and only got worse. Up until TLJ the worst film I'd seen in a movie theater was ROTS.          The Prequels were an unmitigated disaster. Go watch the redlettermedia reviews again.
I have indicated to General Brown that uh - the words that he used in that interview, in that particular case and in several others, were very ill advised.
How many conservative climate change deniers are scientists? I understand your point, but I trust the ability of Nobel Prize winners to learn about other fields of science more than some random Alberta conservative.
I think **QUINNIPIAC** knows more about polling than you do so settle down.
John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains.
If you never laced up a pair of combat boots, STFU
If they are trash how come u r playing their game? A famous game does not have trash developers.
Again, it may not work, but if it doesn't work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned.
People out there listening know what I believe.
Hahah, I'm a nurse and it's SO annoying. I keep getting ridiculous phone calls from friends and family and it's true what they say, common sense isn't very common now a days. Haha
I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy.
youre calling a scientist dumb...
As George Will said the other day, Freedom on the march; not in Russia right now.
In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, Bob, all I've got is my Social Security and my Medicare, don't cut it. I wouldn't violate anything my mother said. In fact, we had a conversation about our mothers one day, a very poignant conversation in the White House. I'm concerned about healthcare.
I have no stake in this. I KNOW where this came from. Shes my cousin. A Rhodes scholar and a defense attorney with that DAs office. You can sit here and make assumptions but Im going to continue to try to warn those who care to listen.
Your friend should not be refusing her doctors treatment plan
The less educated part of my Family who get their news via Facebook has been sending me panicked text messages about this.  They just cant decrypt between hoax and real news.  I told them I would help them with what to ignore and what to listen to. First thing I am doing is teaching them about official sources of information (ex: Governor twitter account) vs batshit crazy guy on Facebook.
I'm very pleased that the Fraternal Order of Police in Little Rock, Arkansas endorsed me because I think they see I'm trying to strengthen the anti-crime legislation.
But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.
It's easy to disagree with someone that you think knows less than you or only has an average amount of knowledge about a subject. When it's an expert opinion though, you just look like an ass arguing against them That's just an opinion though, MY opinion
Not to a asshole. But I am gonna beleive the freaking guy who discovered HIV AIDS, rather then Wire , who I have never heard about.
I wish he could have been with me when I sat with a group of teenagers who were black, and who were telling me about their unemployment problems, and that it was the minimum wage that had done away with the jobs that they once could get.
Lmfao it is there to teach mashers not to mash all the time. So professional players are mashing all the time? No? Then your argument is bs.
&gt; The word Conservative in political context has ALWAYS been associated with being against Democracy.  https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conservatism/ argues that you are wrong. In the choice between Stanford and a random redditor, one should of course choose Stanford.
I think people understand what she's saying.  But they see a compassionate, strong, great first lady in Laura Bush.
You're putting a lot of business people out of business. Small businessmen and businesswomen who paid 70 percent of your ninteen , your$265 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of America. I said that one day and Pat Moynihan, a Democrat, say, no, he said, in the history of the world. So I modified it, the largest tax increase in the history of the world.
Because it's a player shitting on the media, and this sub loves it when players call out the media even though we'll turn around and believe basically whatever the media says.  We all want to feel high and mighty sticking it to the media or whatever saying they're trash and laughing at their jobs saying anyone could do them and acting like we're superior or some shit, but then like 30 minutes later we'll turn around and believe every single word they say and take it as truth and let it spin narratives on this sub as we circlejerk into oblivion.   It's hilarious how hypocritical this sub is.
And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Senator McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me.
Not worth anybodys time this isnt a scholar of Islam so him reviewing the Quran is just useless for Muslims .  I suggest you post this in a different sub , and even then he still doesnt have what it takes to explain the Quran but at least people may sympathize more (even though hes unqualified for the job) .
It's his trustees, the President's trustees, not mine, who says it's going to go broke.
But as Admiral Yarnell has said, and he's been supported by most military authority, these islands that we're now talking about are not worth the bones of a single American soldier; and I know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment.
Why would you put more faith in what random ass people on the internet say than what trainers of multi-billion dollar franchises do?
Thomas Aquinas is one of the most respected philosophers of all time... it's rather absurd to claim that you can refute his work with an elementary objection.  IE All things require a cause external to themselves, but the first thing would need an external cause that had no external cause. We don't know any alternative to this, (and when you present one we'll simply assert it's impossible without evidence), and we don't know what it could be, therefore God exists.  This is a horrible mangling of Aquinas's arguments, or any theological arguments. Did you get this from reading atheist websites or books?  No cosmological argument says everything needs a cause, those are the only places you can find that strawman. If you want to know what Aquinas or other philosophers say, read their work instead of how other atheists strawman them.
yeah, don't get your hopes up that the CEO of one of the major social media outlets, as well as one of the easiest digital payment systems available for fiat, who's also heavily invested in mechanisms to increase blockchain usability, has publicly claimed that digital currencies stemming from blockchain are the future.  Everything you're saying is WHY people should get their hopes up. A major player in the space is publicly endorsing it, and they have the power and potential to flip a few switches and suddenly embed Twitter + Cash + Square with lightning.    But no, we should listen to anonymous redditor for 2 days shitposters instead for our signals.  herrrrp deeeerrrrpppp
And I think I'm more in touch with the mainstream of America. They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance.
This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly.
I want to quote somebody a little closer to home, Harry Truman. He said, The buck stops here.''
And we handled it responsibly and I think Captain Miller's testimony to that effect is the best evidence.
Sure, but when all the pros or big streamers say they don't like the changes, it at least makes you think that something's not entirely right
I have been talking to a number of Congressmen who have much the same idea that I have, and that is that in the inner city areas, that in cooperation with the local government and the national Government, and using tax incentives and with cooperating with the private sector, that we have development zones.
Uh - He sent a mission - the President - in 1955 of Mr. uh - Robertson and Admiral Radford. General Twining said they were still doing it in 1959. General Ridgway said - who was Chief of Staff: To go to war for Quemoy and Matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take. To me that concept is completely repugnant. So I stand with them. I stand with the Secretary of State, Mr. Herter, who said these islands were indefensible.
This is where a person who is biased is trying to twist the data into their own narrative, which is never good on either side. You are telling me that one of the most decorated and elite fighter squadrons with top of the line sensors in the NAVY couldn't tell the difference between a plane and an unknown? That is super insulting to the pilots, who are arguable the best in the world, and to say this sitting looking at solely a computer screen is beyond hubris. Try this, that is an unknown and that is it, don't say it is alien or a plane, and leave it as unknown - not everything has an answer with our understanding of science.
Then protest by standing on your roof top or  invite whole world into your house. Just dont block roads to hospitals n then dont go to hospital if you participated in protest n now you contracted corona virus.  You are not smarter than all the world leaders, doctors, researchers, policy makers , economists and scientists.   Only your town is not on lockdown. If whole world is panicking may b there is something to panic.
if you can't launch a rocket keep your opinion in your pocket
I would like to say that President Ford, who was within 90% of a treaty that we could be in agreement with when he left office, is emphatically against this SALT treaty. I would like to point out also that senators like Henry Jackson and Hollings of South Carolina - they are taking the lead in the fight against this particular treaty.
You see, I'd have found a way to sign that bill. Governor Thompson of Illinois did.
The American people see this debt, and they know it's got to come down.
And Governor Romney's says he's got a five-point plan? Governor Romney doesn't have a five-point plan. He has a one-point plan. And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules. That's been his philosophy in the private sector, that's been his philosophy as governor, that's been his philosophy as a presidential candidate.
I am both a goalie and a USA hockey certified referee. If a goalie takes a slap shot in or near the head and goes down, you call the play dead IMMEDIATELY. What the referees did was extremely irresponsible and affected the outcome of the game.  They should be ashamed of themselves.
Jewish people are calling them concentration camps.
This, or that everyones opinions are equally valid. No, the guy who has a PhD and 10years of experience in the fields opinion is more valid than your 10min google search.
And the Los Angeles Times spent a lot of ink going into that.
Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible.
Tipper and I have worked on the problem of violence in entertainment aimed at children. She's worked on it longer than I have.
Sam Harris is an intellectual giant compared to Ben Shapiro. You need only watch Shapiros own show when he had Harris as a guest to see this.
Dear Blizzard, please listen to me, expert with zero experience 
I don't know if you calling it drivel should somehow carry more weight than a company with lots of analysts and data intentionally gimping one of their free-of-development-costs selling points.  I didn't really read up on the economic reasons behind it, but I believe them when they say that they make more money this way. Why would they do it in your opinion? Just to spite you?
Honestly though, a PhD is not necessary to have an informed opinion. If that were the case, a lot of pro vaxxers wouldn't have an informed opinion either and let's be honest: they don't. Herd mentality is as much a thing as herd immunity.   What antivaxxers need is someone with a PhD drawing a conclusion they agree with so they can repeat and circlejerk that to oblivion. And someone with a PhD should know the difference between an actual result and oh hey one number out of 100 says this so it must be true.   And even then they will be a minority, but at least it can sufficiently instigate some doubt.
I do want to say that I was just endorsedâ€”and more are coming next weekâ€”it will be over 200 admirals, many of them hereâ€”admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country.
John McCain is for me for president because he understands I have the right view in winning the war on terror and that my plan will succeed in Iraq.
Lol. It's a Mark Twain quote. Literally the opposite of your post.
That's what the economists tell us.
Yeah, this doctor is a moron. Not smart like you.
People with a knowledge of American history have way more validity to talk than mailmen or whatever you do.
When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world.
I will go out on a limb, and say the Japanese chef for cooks these professionally might know more about how to do it correctly ... than you do.
People in this thread actually think they're smarter than Harvard law students
hm who would I trust? A Harvard professor that expertises in economics? Or an random redditor that knows just about zero in economics? I definitely wont choose the latter.
The terrorism czar, who has worked for every president since Ronald Reagan, said, Invading Iraq in response to 9/11 would be like Franklin Roosevelt invading Mexico in response to Pearl Harbor.
And you know, according to my mother and my wife and my daughter, this world would be a lot better place if women were running it most of the time.
Carl Gustav Jung (most prominent psychologist ever) compared Adolf Hitler to Mohammed. So to all the soyboys who claim oh no, you are stupid for comparing them - the smartest man in psychology did it so who is stupid now?
In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society -- that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society.
You know, one of the reasons so many Republicans are supporting the Clinton- Gore ticket is because they've turned over the party to this right wing extremist group which takes positions on issues like abortion that don't even allow exceptions for rape and incest.
I talked to an African-American police officer in Springfield, Massachusetts not long ago who raised this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest solutions is in the training.
The platform on which Mr. Kemp and Senator Dole are running pledges a constitutional amendment to take away a woman's right to choose and to have the government come in and order that woman to do what the government says, no matter what the circumstances. Mr. Kemp has voted 47 out of 47 times to have such an amendment and to restrict this completely, no matter what the circumstances, even where rape and incest is involved.
And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say .
The MD, PhD, MBA medical professor who posted it must have some faith in the source.  What's your credentials?
Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford and they've criticized the foreign policy of this administration. This is one instance where I agree with - with the Republican platform.
Smarter than Hillary. He is the president.
That's just unacceptable, and for Al Gore to keep suggesting that we can't afford to reduce the tax rates across-the-board on the American people and on the formation of the capital necessary to create the new jobs for America is just totally at odds with the experience of both Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy and other times in this century.
this is Tulsi Gabbards own piece which denies any Russian involvement despite the Senate Intelligence Commitee, House Intelligence Committee, Office of Director of National Intelligence, CIA, FBI, NSA as well as foreign intelligence agencies esp Dutch, UK, France, Estonia and Australia all stating definite Russian interference in the US elections  Tulsi disagrees with all of them yet does not have a source for her own insights  I think the governor of Hawaii has asked her not to represent them anymore in Congress  I have tried to list all facts  Russia if youre listening
Right from the bottom up, the American people have got to say they want it.
I think I know the correct answer to this but I need proof.   I was watching a game yesterday and a player was flying Obi-Wan in the aethersprite. He performs a red maneuver and says that since the maneuver was fully executed he can use FTC before the check stress step. I tried explaining that a maneuver isn't considered fully executed until after the check stress step. Just trying to get clarification on which is right. He said he has talked to tourney judges and they said that FTC can be used before the check stress step. That doesn't seem right to me.
I don't favor abortion. I don't think it's a good thing. I don't think most people do.
The authors who made the initial claim have already withdrawn the claim. If the people who researched and wrote that report don't believe that now, why should you?
The American people want arms control.
I notice that Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal. which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate. And Business Week, which is not a Democratic publication, said that this Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal - and I quote them, I think - was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this nation.
Older people have more life experience and wisdom and are generally able to make better decisions than 18 year olds. This disdain for the elderly is actually quite disgusting.
But that's literally what the expert economists suggest doing.    Regardless, all that getting rid of cap and trade did was introduce a more generic climate tax.  What would you suggest the way to fight climate change is?
Thomas Jefferson: If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered.... I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.  Alan Greenspan confirming what Jefferson warned the US about: https://youtu.be/K38khtCrN-4
But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want.
It doesn't? Oh thank God I'm cured, thank God all those doctors with medical Doctor nes and years of experience were just wrong.
And I'm interested in what we can trust him to do and what you can trust me to do and what you can trust Mr. Perot to do for the next 4 years. So I think you're right and I hope the rest of the night belongs to you.
and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients .
It happened because I could work with people -- Republicans and Democrats. That's why we've had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, many of them Republican, support this campaign.
You can't really claim lately, and then link an article from 2016.  Edit: If you need further proof, you should check out kubernetes (or openshift). That's how Google does stuff, they use containers. Netflix also does.  Guess you probably heard of those.
For two years, the president didn't even engage with North Korea, did nothing at all, while it was growing more dangerous, despite the warnings of former Secretary of Defense William Perry, who negotiated getting television cameras and inspectors into that reactor.
Maryland would not extradite Willie Horton, the man who was furloughed, the murderer, because they didn't want him to be furloughed again.
Im assuming that the Chief Public Heath Officer of Canada has access to mountains of data that you cant find just by clicking a link or reading a journal. If she gave a press conference or interview in her official role, no one would ask her for sources. Why is it different when shes tweeting using her official account?
This is kind of on the same level as Why would i believe in a god that does this and that. I think questioning god is out of our place and that we have no way of understanding some of his reasons.
So you think Swift, Oracle, Google Cloud etc get involved with scams?
There are two distinguished authors on arms control in this country -- there are many others, but two that I want to cite tonight. One is Strobe Talbott in his classic book, Deadly Gambits.'' The other is John Neuhaus, who's one of the most distinguished arms control specialists in our country. Both said that this administration turned down the walk in the woods'' agreement first, and that would have been a perfect agreement from the standpoint of the United States in Europe and our security.
Understood, I would agree.  I'm posting it because it's from the BBC so I expect it to be well sourced by them.
No guys you don't understand, Byrnes hit for the cycle one time, so he knows what he's talking about.

The borderâ€”as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me .
I *kind of* agree, because we essentially let parents do it, and teachers are in a similar position of authority (both parents' and teachers' roles are to install discipline), but the problem is that it kind of opens up a can of worms - if we're saying that they can be hit because they are at the age of accountability (as opposed to being too young) then surely this would mean any adult can be hit for criminal behaviour? is that a road we want to go down? but I know what you mean - maybe it's not at the age of accountability, and maybe it's at the age where the only thing they'll understand is pain and not guilt
Well, here's the problem with it: It sounds very good, but there's a reason that 500 economists, including seven Nobel prize winners and business periodicals like Business Week, and even Senator Dole's friends, Senator Warren Rudman, former Republican senator from New Hampshire, says it's not a practical program.
Dr. Leon Eisenberg, the father of ADHD, said just before his death that ADHD is a prime example of a fictitious disease.
Virtually all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed.   Idiot
He's already got $3 trillion, according to The Washington Post, of expenses that he's put on the line from his convention and the promises of this campaign, none of which are paid for. Not one of them are paid for.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever... All your post is countered easily by one thing - Golden Lion in Venice. These are not the kind of people who watch only mainstream movies, and they selected it over any other movie at the festival. So, your argument is invalid from the start.
I'm not trying to defend Respawn here, but why is it that everyone on reddit always has the answer? They have a ton of data telling them way more than whatever people are yelling about here.  Sure there might a vocal majority(or minority in reality) on reddit wanting solos, but what if their data doesnt support it? What if a tiny percent of the playerbase actually played solo when it was available. What if those who are most vocal are just a very small minorty of players.  More than likely they have so much information from every one of us playing the game that they probably have a good idea about what they are doing.  Not to mention what they have already said, the game was developed and built around squads and teamplay. All the legend abilites, knockdown shields, ress beacons etc focus on teamplay. They obviously have a philosophy behind what they want and what they are doing.
Our people will be glad to furnish the press, if they're interested, in Senator Gore's voting record on the Caribbean Basin Initiative.
Well, the president's own CIA director says Saddam is stronger now than he was.
I shouldn't be surprised at something this ignorant coming from a subreddit about denying a massively agreed upon subject in the scientific community.
I'll give some initial thoughts:  Economic growth occurs when an economy produces more valuable goods.  Not when people lack the money to buy such goods.  1. It decreases the incentive for workers to quickly find new employment  once theyre out of a job, and 2) it decreases their sensitivity to  income differences between jobs.  Though he doesn't cite where he's getting this info (it seems he might be assuming this), I'd like to counter this by adding that people on disability would then have the buying power to re-enter the labor force.  It's also interesting to note that this was written by an economics student. Yang has an econ degree from brown and the idea he's proposing was supported by over 1000 other economists in 1970-72. 1000 economists vs an economics student. I'm inclined to listen to the consensus of many experts over the ideas of one student.
Alright, so apparently a guy who isnt a fighter pilot, has no experience in this field, can tell you that this isnt anything interesting? The pilots themselves remarked that these objects were strange, i dont think theyd be confused about seeing a plane on their flir, thats what they do for christs sake. He tries to act all smart because he knows what a TGP is but in reality he just dismisses everything with really lazy half-baked shit. What an absolute ape.
I've just looked at his profile: Invented and led 49 new capabilities in predictive analytics, Machine Learning and AI. While he was the global leader of analytics and Data Science at Capgemini, I think you are all just jealous, how many new capabilities in those areas have you invented...?
If you would actually like to hear an answer to this, feel free to message me. I hold advanced degrees in biological engineering and the more I learn about the body and the world, the more I wonder how people can manage not to believe in a God. Having explanations for some science stuff is a far cry from disproving God. The opposite, IMHO.
NBA coaches don't think so but I guess you know more than them.
the military portions of our plan, even though he was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs under George Bush, and John White has endorsed the economic aspects of our plan, even though I believe he was the architect of Ross Perot's economic plan.
How many Pulitzers do you have again?
But I disagree with them, as do many.
But people know where I stand.
But I think that we should find a way to allow some kind of civic unions, and I basically agree with Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman.
When people who play in the professional scene and other people in the top 10-1% agree  a hero is bad, its probably because that hero is bad. Or do the players in the top 10%+ not play hard enough?
Uhh - I believe also that uh - there is some merit to a - an amendment that uh - uh - Senator Everett Dirksen uh - proposed very frequently, an amendment that would uh - change the court decision as far as voluntary prayer in public schools.
Right, because you know more than Elizabeth Warren.
I'm simply advocating following the example of Jesus. Which is what being a Christian is all about, if I understand it correctly.
That, I think, is a mistake and I think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care.
Its a shame hes using a global crisis to further his own outreach. Also he isnt from the medical field so shouldnt really be talking about issues he has no authority on.
